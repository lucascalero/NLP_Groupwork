    "Step 1: Word2Vec paper questions\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "1. Describe how a CBOW word embedding is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A feedforward Neural Net without a hidden layer with a shared projection layer is used to classify the current word on every iteration based on its context (previous and future words). The output is a word embedding of size V.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a CBOW word embedding and how is it different from a skip-gram word embedding?\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference between skip-gram and CBOW is the fact that skip-gram uses the current word as the input into the classifier and predicts words within a range R of the word 1 < R < C where C is the maxiumum distance. This technique allows for weighted classification depending on the distance from w(i) and the current word.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the task that the authors use to evaluate the generated word embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors use the Semantic-Syntactic Word Relationship test set to evaluate their generated word embeddings, a test set developed by them for this paper and for future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are PCA and t-SNE? Why are these important to the task of training and interpreting word embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA and t-SNE are methods of dimensionality reduction, projecting high-dimensional word embeddings into lower dimensional space. This is important foor training and interpreting word embeddings since embeddings can become extremely high dimensional, and projecting them into a lower space will both speed up training time and make it easier for humans to visualize and therefore interpret."

this madea hole, and he would not put anything in its place.', '_“I will die,”_ hesaid, _“rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart!”_ He liked toscoff aloud at Louis XVIII.', '“The gouty old creature in Englishgaiters!” he said; _“let him take himself off to Prussia with thatqueue of his.”_ He was happy to combine in the same imprecation the twothings which he most detested, Prussia and England.', 'He did it so oftenthat he lost his place.', 'There he was, turned out of the house, with hiswife and children, and without bread.', 'The Bishop sent for him, reprovedhim gently, and appointed him beadle in the cathedral.In the course of nine years Monseigneur Bienvenu had, by dint of holydeeds and gentle manners, filled the town of D——with a sort of tenderand filial reverence.', 'Even his conduct towards Napoleon had beenaccepted and tacitly pardoned, as it were, by the people, the good andweakly flock who adored their emperor, but loved their bishop.CHAPTER XII—THE SOLITUDE OF MONSEIGNEUR WELCOMEA bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of littleabbés, just as a general is by a covey of young officers.', 'This is whatthat charming Saint François de Sales calls somewhere “les prêtresblancs-becs,” callow priests.', 'Every career has its aspirants, who forma train for those who have attained eminence in it.', 'There is no powerwhich has not its dependents.', 'There is no fortune which has not itscourt.', 'The seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present.Every metropolis has its staff of officials.', 'Every bishop who possessesthe least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from theseminary, which goes the round, and maintains good order in theepiscopal palace, and mounts guard over monseigneur’s smile.', 'To pleasea bishop is equivalent to getting one’s foot in the stirrup for asub-diaconate.', 'It is necessary to walk one’s path discreetly;

hence life and death.He seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against a decrepitvine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted silhouettes ofhis fruit-trees.', 'This quarter of an acre, so poorly planted, soencumbered with mean buildings and sheds, was dear to him, andsatisfied his wants.What more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure of hislife, where there was so little leisure, between gardening in thedaytime and contemplation at night?', 'Was not this narrow enclosure, withthe heavens for a ceiling, sufficient to enable him to adore God in hismost divine works, in turn?', 'Does not this comprehend all, in fact?', 'andwhat is there left to desire beyond it?', 'A little garden in which towalk, and immensity in which to dream.', 'At one’s feet that which can becultivated and plucked;

many works.', 'Abstruse speculations contain vertigo; no,there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses.The apostle may be daring, but the bishop must be timid.', 'He wouldprobably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certainproblems which are, in a manner, reserved for terrible great minds.There is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma;

he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell ofevents; he did not see to condense in flame the light of things; he hadnothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him.', 'Thishumble soul loved, and that was all.That he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration isprobable: but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much;and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts, Saint Theresa and SaintJerome would be heretics.He inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates.', 'The universeappeared to him like an immense malady; everywhere he felt fever,everywhere he heard the sound of suffering, and, without seeking tosolve the enigma, he strove to dress the wound.', 'The terrible spectacleof created things developed tenderness in him; he was occupied only infinding for himself, and in inspiring others with the best way tocompassionate and relieve.', 'That which exists was for this good and rarepriest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation.There are men who toil at extracting gold;

the strongest has the most wit.', 'Your _love each other_ isnonsense.”—_“Well,”_ replied Monseigneur Welcome, without contestingthe point, _“if it is nonsense, the soul should shut itself up in it,as the pearl in the oyster.”_ Thus he shut himself up, he lived there,he was absolutely satisfied with it, leaving on one side the prodigiousquestions which attract and terrify, the fathomless perspectives ofabstraction, the precipices of metaphysics—all those profundities whichconverge, for the apostle in God, for the atheist in nothingness;destiny, good and evil, the way of being against being, the conscienceof man, the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal, the transformationin death, the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains, theincomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent _I_,the essence, the substance, the Nile, and the Ens, the soul, nature,liberty, necessity; perpendicular problems, sinister obscurities, wherelean the gigantic archangels of the human mind; formidable abysses,which Lucretius, Manou, Saint Paul, Dante, contemplate with eyesflashing lightning, which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite tocause stars to blaze forth there.Monseigneur Bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior ofmysterious questions without scrutinizing them, and without troublinghis own mind with them, and who cherished in his own soul a graverespect for darkness.BOOK SECOND—THE FALLCHAPTER I—THE EVENING OF A DAY OF WALKINGEarly in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a manwho was travelling on foot entered the little town of D—— The fewinhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at themoment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness.', 'It wasdifficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance.', 'He was aman of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life.', 'Hemight have been forty-six or forty-eight years old.', 'A cap with adrooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned bysun and wind, and dripping with perspiration.', 'His shirt of coarseyellow linen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitteda view of his hairy breast: he had a cravat twisted into a string;trousers of blue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee andtorn on the other;

I am hungry, and I shall remain.”Then the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made himstart, “Go away!”At that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting somebrands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff;

he stammered, “He did notreceive me either.”The peasant’s countenance assumed an expression of distrust; hesurveyed the newcomer from head to feet, and suddenly exclaimed, with asort of shudder:—“Are you the man?—”He cast a fresh glance upon the stranger, took three steps backwards,placed the lamp on the table, and took his gun down from the wall.Meanwhile, at the words, _Are you the man?_ the woman had risen, hadclasped her two children in her arms, and had taken refugeprecipitately behind her husband, staring in terror at the stranger,with her bosom uncovered, and with frightened eyes, as she murmured ina low tone, _“Tso-maraude.”_1All this took place in less time than it requires to picture it toone’s self.', 'After having scrutinized the man for several moments, asone scrutinizes a viper, the master of the house returned to the doorand said:—“Clear out!”“For pity’s sake, a glass of water,” said the man.“A shot from my gun!” said the peasant.Then he closed the door violently, and the man heard him shoot twolarge bolts.', 'A moment later, the window-shutter was closed, and thesound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside.Night continued to fall.', 'A cold wind from the Alps was blowing.', 'By thelight of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardenswhich bordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to bebuilt of sods.', 'He climbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and foundhimself in the garden.', 'He approached the hut; its door consisted of avery low and narrow aperture, and it resembled those buildings whichroad-laborers construct for themselves along the roads.', 'He thoughtwithout doubt, that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; hewas suffering from cold and hunger, but this was, at least, a shelterfrom the cold.', 'This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night.He threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into the hut.', 'It waswarm there, and he found a tolerably good bed of straw.', 'He lay, for amoment, stretched out on this bed, without the power to make amovement, so fatigued was he.', 'Then, as the knapsack on his back was inhis way, and as it furnished, moreover, a pillow ready to his hand, heset about unbuckling one of the straps.', 'At that moment, a ferociousgrowl became audible.', 'He raised his eyes.', 'The head of an enormous dogwas outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut.It was a dog’s kennel.He was himself vigorous and formidable; he armed himself with hisstaff, made a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of thekennel in the best way he could, not without enlarging the rents in hisrags.He left the garden in the same manner, but backwards, being obliged, inorder to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that manœuvrewith his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as _larose couverte_.When he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and foundhimself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, withoutshelter, without a roof over his head, chased even from that bed ofstraw and from that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seatedhimself on a stone, and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim,“I am not even a dog!”He soon rose again and resumed his march.', 'He went out of the town,hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would affordhim shelter.He walked thus for some time, with his head still drooping.', 'When hefelt himself far from every human habitation, he raised his eyes andgazed searchingly about him.', 'He was in a field.', 'Before him was one ofthose low hills covered with close-cut stubble, which, after theharvest, resemble shaved heads.The horizon was perfectly black.', 'This was not alone the obscurity ofnight; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to restupon the hill itself, and which were mounting and filling the wholesky.', 'Meanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, and as there was stillfloating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight, theseclouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch, whence agleam of light fell upon the earth.The earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces aparticularly sinister effect, and the hill, whose contour was poor andmean, was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon.', 'The wholeeffect was hideous, petty, lugubrious, and narrow.There was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree,which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer.This man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits ofintelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysteriousaspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky, inthat hill, in that plain, in that tree, which was so profoundlydesolate, that after a moment of immobility and reverie he turned backabruptly.', 'There are instants when nature seems hostile.He retraced his steps; the gates of D—— were closed.', 'D——, which hadsustained sieges during the wars of religion, was still surrounded in1815 by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have beendemolished since.', 'He passed through a breach and entered the townagain.It might have been eight o’clock in the evening.', 'As he was notacquainted with the streets, he recommenced his walk at random.In this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary.', 'As hepassed through the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at the church.At the corner of this square there is a printing establishment.', 'It isthere that the proclamations of the Emperor and of the Imperial Guardto the army, brought from the Island of Elba and dictated by Napoleonhimself, were printed for the first time.Worn out with fatigue, and no longer entertaining any hope, he lay downon a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office.At that moment an old woman came out of the church.', 'She saw the manstretched out in the shadow.', '“What are you doing there, my friend?”said she.He answered harshly and angrily: “As you see, my good woman, I amsleeping.” The good woman, who was well worthy the name, in fact, wasthe Marquise de R——“On this bench?” she went on.“I have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years,” said the man;“to-day I have a mattress of stone.”“You have been a soldier?”“Yes, my good woman, a soldier.”“Why do you not go to the inn?”“Because I have no money.”“Alas!” said Madame de R——, “I have only four sous in my purse.”“Give it to me all the same.”The man took the four sous.', 'Madame de R—— continued: “You cannot obtainlodgings in an inn for so small a sum.', 'But have you tried?', 'It isimpossible for you to pass the night thus.', 'You are cold and hungry, nodoubt.', 'Some one might have given you a lodging out of charity.”“I have knocked at all doors.”“Well?”“I have been driven away everywhere.”The “good woman” touched the man’s arm, and pointed out to him on theother side of the street a small, low house, which stood beside theBishop’s palace.“You have knocked at all doors?”“Yes.”“Have you knocked at that one?”“No.”“Knock there.”CHAPTER II—PRUDENCE COUNSELLED TO WISDOM.That evening, the Bishop of D——, after his promenade through the town,remained shut up rather late in his room.', 'He was busy over a great workon _Duties_, which was never completed, unfortunately.', 'He was carefullycompiling everything that the Fathers and the doctors have said on thisimportant subject.', 'His book was divided into two parts: firstly, theduties of all; secondly, the duties of each individual, according tothe class to which he belongs.', 'The duties of all are the great duties.There are four of these.', 'Saint Matthew points them out: duties towardsGod (_Matt._ vi.', '); duties towards one’s self (_Matt._ v. 29, 30);duties towards one’s neighbor (_Matt._ vii.', '12); duties towards animals(_Matt._ vi.', '20, 25).', 'As for the other duties the Bishop found thempointed out and prescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns and subjects, inthe Epistle to the Romans; to magistrates, to wives, to mothers, toyoung men, by Saint Peter; to husbands, fathers, children and servants,in the Epistle to the Ephesians; to the faithful, in the Epistle to theHebrews; to virgins, in the Epistle to the Corinthians.', 'Out of theseprecepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole, which hedesired to present to souls.At eight o’clock he was still at work, writing with a good deal ofinconvenience upon little squares of paper, with a big book open on hisknees, when Madame Magloire entered, according to her wont, to get thesilver-ware from the cupboard near his bed.', 'A moment later, the Bishop,knowing that the table was set, and that his sister was probablywaiting for him, shut his book, rose from his table, and entered thedining-room.The dining-room was an oblong apartment, with a fireplace, which had adoor opening on the street (as we have said), and a window opening onthe garden.Madame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches to thetable.As she performed this service, she was conversing with MademoiselleBaptistine.A lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace.', 'A woodfire was burning there.One can easily picture to one’s self these two women, both of whom wereover sixty years of age.', 'Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious;Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller thanher brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which hadlasted ever since.', 'To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit ofgiving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page wouldhardly suffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a _peasant_,and Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a _lady_.', 'Madame Magloire wore awhite quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon herneck, the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, avery white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff,with large, short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and greenchecks, knotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacherof the same attached by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes onher feet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles.Mademoiselle Baptistine’s gown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with ashort waist, a narrow, sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flapsand buttons.', 'She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known asthe _baby_ wig.', 'Madame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, andkindly air; the two corners of her mouth unequally raised, and herupper lip, which was larger than the lower, imparted to her a rathercrabbed and imperious look.', 'So long as Monseigneur held his peace, shetalked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom; but assoon as Monseigneur began to speak, as we have seen, she obeyedpassively like her mistress.', 'Mademoiselle Baptistine did not evenspeak.', 'She confined herself to obeying and pleasing him.', 'She had neverbeen pretty, even when she was young; she had large, blue, prominenteyes, and a long arched nose; but her whole visage, her whole person,breathed forth an ineffable goodness, as we stated in the beginning.She had always been predestined to gentleness; but faith, charity,hope, those three virtues which mildly warm the soul, had graduallyelevated that gentleness to sanctity.', 'Nature had made her a lamb,religion had made her an angel.', 'Poor sainted virgin!', 'Sweet memory whichhas vanished!Mademoiselle Baptistine has so often narrated what passed at theepiscopal residence that evening, that there are many people now livingwho still recall the most minute details.At the moment when the Bishop entered, Madame Magloire was talking withconsiderable vivacity.', 'She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine on asubject which was familiar to her and to which the Bishop was alsoaccustomed.', 'The question concerned the lock upon the entrance door.It appears that while procuring some provisions for supper, MadameMagloire had heard things in divers places.', 'People had spoken of aprowler of evil appearance; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who mustbe somewhere about the town, and those who should take it into theirheads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasantencounters.', 'The police was very badly organized, moreover, becausethere was no love lost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought toinjure each other by making things happen.', 'It behooved wise people toplay the part of their own police, and to guard themselves well, andcare must be taken to duly close, bar and barricade their houses, andto _fasten the doors well_.Madame Magloire emphasized these last words; but the Bishop had justcome from his room, where it was rather cold.', 'He seated himself infront of the fire, and warmed himself, and then fell to thinking ofother things.', 'He did not take up the remark dropped with design byMadame Magloire.', 'She repeated it.', 'Then Mademoiselle Baptistine,desirous of satisfying Madame Magloire without displeasing her brother,ventured to say timidly:—“Did you hear what Madame Magloire is saying, brother?”“I have heard something of it in a vague way,” replied the Bishop.', 'Thenhalf-turning in his chair, placing his hands on his knees, and raisingtowards the old servant woman his cordial face, which so easily grewjoyous, and which was illuminated from below by the firelight,—“Come,what is the matter?', 'What is the matter?', 'Are we in any great danger?”Then Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it alittle without being aware of the fact.', 'It appeared that a Bohemian, abare-footed vagabond, a sort of dangerous mendicant, was at that momentin the town.', 'He had presented himself at Jacquin Labarre’s to obtainlodgings, but the latter had not been willing to take him in.', 'He hadbeen seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard Gassendi and roam aboutthe streets in the gloaming.', 'A gallows-bird with a terrible face.“Really!” said the Bishop.This willingness to interrogate encouraged Madame Magloire; it seemedto her to indicate that the Bishop was on the point of becomingalarmed; she pursued triumphantly:—“Yes, Monseigneur.', 'That is how it is.', 'There will be some sort ofcatastrophe in this town to-night.', 'Every one says so.', 'And withal, thepolice is so badly regulated” (a useful repetition).', '“The idea ofliving in a mountainous country, and not even having lights in thestreets at night!', 'One goes out.', 'Black as ovens, indeed!', 'And I say,Monseigneur, and Mademoiselle there says with me—”“I,” interrupted his sister, “say nothing.', 'What my brother does is welldone.”Madame Magloire continued as though there had been no protest:—“We say that this house is not safe at all; that if Monseigneur willpermit, I will go and tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, to come andreplace the ancient locks on the doors; we have them, and it is onlythe work of a moment; for I say that nothing is more terrible than adoor which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the firstpasser-by; and I say that we need bolts, Monseigneur, if only for thisnight; moreover, Monseigneur has the habit of always saying ‘come in’;and besides, even in the middle of the night, O mon Dieu!', 'there is noneed to ask permission.”At that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door.“Come in,” said the Bishop.CHAPTER III—THE HEROISM OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE.The door opened.It opened wide with a rapid movement, as though some one had given itan energetic and resolute push.A man entered.We already know the man.', 'It was the wayfarer whom we have seenwandering about in search of shelter.He entered, advanced a step, and halted, leaving the door open behindhim.', 'He had his knapsack on his shoulders, his cudgel in his hand, arough, audacious, weary, and violent expression in his eyes.', 'The fireon the hearth lighted him up.', 'He was hideous.', 'It was a sinisterapparition.Madame Magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry.', 'She trembled,and stood with her mouth wide open.Mademoiselle Baptistine turned round, beheld the man entering, and halfstarted up in terror; then, turning her head by degrees towards thefireplace again, she began to observe her brother, and her face becameonce more profoundly calm and serene.The Bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man.As he opened his mouth, doubtless to ask the newcomer what he desired,the man rested both hands on his staff, directed his gaze at the oldman and the two women, and without waiting for the Bishop to speak, hesaid, in a loud voice:—“See here.', 'My name is Jean Valjean.', 'I am a convict from the galleys.', 'Ihave passed nineteen years in the galleys.', 'I was liberated four daysago, and am on my way to Pontarlier, which is my destination.', 'I havebeen walking for four days since I left Toulon.', 'I have travelled adozen leagues to-day on foot.', 'This evening, when I arrived in theseparts, I went to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellowpassport, which I had shown at the town-hall.', 'I had to do it.', 'I went toan inn.', 'They said to me, ‘Be off,’ at both places.', 'No one would takeme.', 'I went to the prison; the jailer would not admit me.', 'I went into adog’s kennel; the dog bit me and chased me off, as though he had been aman.', 'One would have said that he knew who I was.', 'I went into thefields, intending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars.', 'Therewere no stars.', 'I thought it was going to rain, and I re-entered thetown, to seek the recess of a doorway.', 'Yonder, in the square, I meantto sleep on a stone bench.', 'A good woman pointed out your house to me,and said to me, ‘Knock there!’ I have knocked.', 'What is this place?', 'Doyou keep an inn?', 'I have money—savings.', 'One hundred and nine francsfifteen sous, which I earned in the galleys by my labor, in the courseof nineteen years.', 'I will pay.', 'What is that to me?', 'I have money.', 'I amvery weary; twelve leagues on foot; I am very hungry.', 'Are you willingthat I should remain?”“Madame Magloire,” said the Bishop, “you will set another place.”The man advanced three paces, and approached the lamp which was on thetable.', '“Stop,” he resumed, as though he had not quite understood;“that’s not it.', 'Did you hear?', 'I am a galley-slave; a convict.', 'I comefrom the galleys.” He drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellowpaper, which he unfolded.', '“Here’s my passport.', 'Yellow, as you see.', 'Thisserves to expel me from every place where I go.', 'Will you read it?', 'Iknow how to read.', 'I learned in the galleys.', 'There is a school there forthose who choose to learn.', 'Hold, this is what they put on thispassport: ‘Jean Valjean, discharged convict, native of’—that is nothingto you—‘has been nineteen years in the galleys: five years forhouse-breaking and burglary; fourteen years for having attempted toescape on four occasions.', 'He is a very dangerous man.’ There!', 'Every onehas cast me out.', 'Are you willing to receive me?', 'Is this an inn?', 'Willyou give me something to eat and a bed?', 'Have you a stable?”“Madame Magloire,” said the Bishop, “you will put white sheets on thebed in the alcove.” We have already explained the character of the twowomen’s obedience.Madame Magloire retired to execute these orders.The Bishop turned to the man.“Sit down, sir, and warm yourself.', 'We are going to sup in a fewmoments, and your bed will be prepared while you are supping.”At this point the man suddenly comprehended.', 'The expression of hisface, up to that time sombre and harsh, bore the imprint ofstupefaction, of doubt, of joy, and became extraordinary.', 'He beganstammering like a crazy man:—“Really?', 'What!', 'You will keep me?', 'You do not drive me forth?', 'A convict!You call me _sir!_ You do not address me as _thou?_ ‘Get out of here,you dog!’ is what people always say to me.', 'I felt sure that you wouldexpel me, so I told you at once who I am.', 'Oh, what a good woman thatwas who directed me hither!', 'I am going to sup!', 'A bed with a mattressand sheets, like the rest of the world!', 'a bed!', 'It is nineteen yearssince I have slept in a bed!', 'You actually do not want me to go!', 'You aregood people.', 'Besides, I have money.', 'I will pay well.', 'Pardon me,monsieur the inn-keeper, but what is your name?', 'I will pay anything youask.', 'You are a fine man.', 'You are an inn-keeper, are you not?”“I am,” replied the Bishop, “a priest who lives here.”“A priest!” said the man.', '“Oh, what a fine priest!', 'Then you are notgoing to demand any money of me?', 'You are the curé, are you not?', 'thecuré of this big church?', 'Well!', 'I am a fool, truly!', 'I had not perceivedyour skull-cap.”As he spoke, he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner,replaced his passport in his pocket, and seated himself.', 'MademoiselleBaptistine gazed mildly at him.', 'He continued:“You are humane, Monsieur le Curé; you have not scorned me.', 'A goodpriest is a very good thing.', 'Then you do not require me to pay?”“No,” said the Bishop; “keep your money.', 'How much have you?', 'Did you nottell me one hundred and nine francs?”“And fifteen sous,” added the man.“One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous.', 'And how long did it take youto earn that?”“Nineteen years.”“Nineteen years!”The Bishop sighed deeply.The man continued: “I have still the whole of my money.', 'In four days Ihave spent only twenty-five sous, which I earned by helping unload somewagons at Grasse.', 'Since you are an abbé, I will tell you that we had achaplain in the galleys.', 'And one day I saw a bishop there.', 'Monseigneuris what they call him.', 'He was the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles.', 'He isthe curé who rules over the other curés, you understand.', 'Pardon me, Isay that very badly; but it is such a far-off thing to me!', 'Youunderstand what we are!', 'He said mass in the middle of the galleys, onan altar.', 'He had a pointed thing, made of gold, on his head; itglittered in the bright light of midday.', 'We were all ranged in lines onthe three sides, with cannons with lighted matches facing us.', 'We couldnot see very well.', 'He spoke; but he was too far off, and we did nothear.', 'That is what a bishop is like.”While he was speaking, the Bishop had gone and shut the door, which hadremained wide open.Madame Magloire returned.', 'She brought a silver fork and spoon, whichshe placed on the table.“Madame Magloire,” said the Bishop, “place those things as near thefire as possible.” And turning to his guest: “The night wind is harshon the Alps.', 'You must be cold, sir.”Each time that he uttered the word _sir_, in his voice which was sogently grave and polished, the man’s face lighted up.', '_Monsieur_ to aconvict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the_Medusa_.', 'Ignominy thirsts for consideration.“This lamp gives a very bad light,” said the Bishop.Madame Magloire understood him, and went to get the two silvercandlesticks from the chimney-piece in Monseigneur’s bed-chamber, andplaced them, lighted, on the table.“Monsieur le Curé,” said the man, “you are good; you do not despise me.You receive me into your house.', 'You light your candles for me.', 'Yet Ihave not concealed from you whence I come and that I am an unfortunateman.”The Bishop, who was sitting close to him, gently touched his hand.', '“Youcould not help telling me who you were.', 'This is not my house; it is thehouse of Jesus Christ.', 'This door does not demand of him who enterswhether he has a name, but whether he has a grief.', 'You suffer, you arehungry and thirsty; you are welcome.', 'And do not thank me; do not saythat I receive you in my house.', 'No one is at home here, except the manwho needs a refuge.', 'I say to you, who are passing by, that you are muchmore at home here than I am myself.', 'Everything here is yours.', 'What needhave I to know your name?', 'Besides, before you told me you had one whichI knew.”The man opened his eyes in astonishment.“Really?', 'You knew what I was called?”“Yes,” replied the Bishop, “you are called my brother.”“Stop, Monsieur le Curé,” exclaimed the man.', '“I was very hungry when Ientered here; but you are so good, that I no longer know what hashappened to me.”The Bishop looked at him, and said,—“You have suffered much?”“Oh, the red coat, the ball on the ankle, a plank to sleep on, heat,cold, toil, the convicts, the thrashings, the double chain for nothing,the cell for one word; even sick and in bed, still the chain!', 'Dogs,dogs are happier!', 'Nineteen years!', 'I am forty-six.', 'Now there is theyellow passport.', 'That is what it is like.”“Yes,” resumed the Bishop, “you have come from a very sad place.Listen.', 'There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of arepentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men.', 'Ifyou emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrathagainst mankind, you are deserving of pity; if you emerge with thoughtsof good-will and of peace, you are more worthy than any one of us.”In the meantime, Madame Magloire had served supper: soup, made withwater, oil, bread, and salt; a little bacon, a bit of mutton, figs, afresh cheese, and a large loaf of rye bread.', 'She had, of her ownaccord, added to the Bishop’s ordinary fare a bottle of his old Mauveswine.The Bishop’s face at once assumed that expression of gayety which ispeculiar to hospitable natures.', '“To table!” he cried vivaciously.', 'Aswas his custom when a stranger supped with him, he made the man sit onhis right.', 'Mademoiselle Baptistine, perfectly peaceable and natural,took her seat at his left.The Bishop asked a blessing; then helped the soup himself, according tohis custom.', 'The man began to eat with avidity.All at once the Bishop said: “It strikes me there is something missingon this table.”Madame Magloire had, in fact, only placed the three sets of forks andspoons which were absolutely necessary.', 'Now, it was the usage of thehouse, when the Bishop had any one to supper, to lay out the whole sixsets of silver on the table-cloth—an innocent ostentation.', 'Thisgraceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child’s play, which was fullof charm in that gentle and severe household, which raised poverty intodignity.Madame Magloire understood the remark, went out without saying a word,and a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demandedby the Bishop were glittering upon the cloth, symmetrically arrangedbefore the three persons seated at the table.CHAPTER IV—DETAILS CONCERNING THE CHEESE-DAIRIES OF PONTARLIER.Now, in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table, we cannotdo better than to transcribe here a passage from one of MademoiselleBaptistine’s letters to Madame Boischevron, wherein the conversationbetween the convict and the Bishop is described with ingeniousminuteness.“.', '.', '.', 'This man paid no attention to any one.', 'He ate with the voracityof a starving man.', 'However, after supper he said:“‘Monsieur le Curé of the good God, all this is far too good for me;but I must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with themkeep a better table than you do.’“Between ourselves, the remark rather shocked me.', 'My brother replied:—“‘They are more fatigued than I.’“‘No,’ returned the man, ‘they have more money.', 'You are poor; I seethat plainly.', 'You cannot be even a curate.', 'Are you really a curé?', 'Ah,if the good God were but just, you certainly ought to be a curé!’“‘The good God is more than just,’ said my brother.“A moment later he added:—“‘Monsieur Jean Valjean, is it to Pontarlier that you are going?’“‘With my road marked out for me.’“I think that is what the man said.', 'Then he went on:—“‘I must be on my way by daybreak to-morrow.', 'Travelling is hard.', 'If thenights are cold, the days are hot.’“‘You are going to a good country,’ said my brother.', '‘During theRevolution my family was ruined.', 'I took refuge in Franche-Comté atfirst, and there I lived for some time by the toil of my hands.', 'My willwas good.', 'I found plenty to occupy me.', 'One has only to choose.', 'Thereare paper mills, tanneries, distilleries, oil factories, watchfactories on a large scale, steel mills, copper works, twenty ironfoundries at least, four of which, situated at Lods, at Châtillon, atAudincourt, and at Beure, are tolerably large.’“I think I am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which mybrother mentioned.', 'Then he interrupted himself and addressed me:—“‘Have we not some relatives in those parts, my dear sister?’“I replied,—“‘We did have some; among others, M. de Lucenet, who was captain of thegates at Pontarlier under the old régime.’“‘Yes,’ resumed my brother; ‘but in ’93, one had no longer anyrelatives, one had only one’s arms.', 'I worked.', 'They have, in the countryof Pontarlier, whither you are going, Monsieur Valjean, a trulypatriarchal and truly charming industry, my sister.', 'It is theircheese-dairies, which they call _fruitières_.’“Then my brother, while urging the man to eat, explained to him, withgreat minuteness, what these _fruitières_ of Pontarlier were; that theywere divided into two classes: the _big barns_ which belong to therich, and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from sevento eight thousand cheeses each summer, and the _associated fruitières_,which belong to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, whohold their cows in common, and share the proceeds.', '‘They engage theservices of a cheese-maker, whom they call the _grurin_; the _grurin_receives the milk of the associates three times a day, and marks thequantity on a double tally.', 'It is towards the end of April that thework of the cheese-dairies begins;

his father was called Jean Valjean or Vlajean, probably asobriquet, and a contraction of _voilà_ Jean, “here’s Jean.”Jean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition whichconstitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures.', 'On the whole,however, there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant aboutJean Valjean in appearance, at least.', 'He had lost his father and motherat a very early age.', 'His mother had died of a milk fever, which had notbeen properly attended to.', 'His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, hadbeen killed by a fall from a tree.', 'All that remained to Jean Valjeanwas a sister older than himself,—a widow with seven children, boys andgirls.', 'This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and so long as she hada husband she lodged and fed her young brother.The husband died.', 'The eldest of the seven children was eight years old.The youngest, one.Jean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year.', 'He took thefather’s place, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had broughthim up.', 'This was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly onthe part of Jean Valjean.', 'Thus his youth had been spent in rude andill-paid toil.', 'He had never known a “kind woman friend” in his nativeparts.', 'He had not had the time to fall in love.He returned at night weary, and ate his broth without uttering a word.His sister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast fromhis bowl while he was eating,—a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, theheart of the cabbage,—to give to one of her children.', 'As he went oneating, with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup, hislong hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes, he had theair of perceiving nothing and allowing it.', 'There was at Faverolles, notfar from the Valjean thatched cottage, on the other side of the lane, afarmer’s wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean children, habituallyfamished, sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint of milk, intheir mother’s name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some alleycorner, snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the littlegirls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks.', 'If their motherhad known of this marauding, she would have punished the delinquentsseverely.', 'Jean Valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid Marie-Claude forthe pint of milk behind their mother’s back, and the children were notpunished.In pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day;

he emergedimpassive.', 'He had entered in despair; he emerged gloomy.What had taken place in that soul?CHAPTER VII—THE INTERIOR OF DESPAIRLet us try to say it.It is necessary that society should look at these things, because it isitself which creates them.He was, as we have said, an ignorant man, but he was not a fool.', 'Thelight of nature was ignited in him.', 'Unhappiness, which also possesses aclearness of vision of its own, augmented the small amount of daylightwhich existed in this mind.', 'Beneath the cudgel, beneath the chain, inthe cell, in hardship, beneath the burning sun of the galleys, upon theplank bed of the convict, he withdrew into his own consciousness andmeditated.He constituted himself the tribunal.He began by putting himself on trial.He recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustlypunished.', 'He admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthyact; that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused tohim had he asked for it; that, in any case, it would have been betterto wait until he could get it through compassion or through work; thatit is not an unanswerable argument to say, “Can one wait when one ishungry?” That, in the first place, it is very rare for any one to dieof hunger, literally; and next, that, fortunately or unfortunately, manis so constituted that he can suffer long and much, both morally andphysically, without dying; that it is therefore necessary to havepatience; that that would even have been better for those poor littlechildren; that it had been an act of madness for him, a miserable,unfortunate wretch, to take society at large violently by the collar,and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft; that thatis in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery throughwhich infamy enters; in short, that he was in the wrong.Then he asked himself:—Whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history.', 'Whetherit was not a serious thing, that he, a laborer, out of work, that he,an industrious man, should have lacked bread.', 'And whether, the faultonce committed and confessed, the chastisement had not been ferociousand disproportioned.', 'Whether there had not been more abuse on the partof the law, in respect to the penalty, than there had been on the partof the culprit in respect to his fault.', 'Whether there had not been anexcess of weights in one balance of the scale, in the one whichcontains expiation.', 'Whether the over-weight of the penalty was notequivalent to the annihilation of the crime, and did not result inreversing the situation, of replacing the fault of the delinquent bythe fault of the repression, of converting the guilty man into thevictim, and the debtor into the creditor, and of ranging the lawdefinitely on the side of the man who had violated it.Whether this penalty, complicated by successive aggravations forattempts at escape, had not ended in becoming a sort of outrageperpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler, a crime of societyagainst the individual, a crime which was being committed afresh everyday, a crime which had lasted nineteen years.He asked himself whether human society could have the right to forceits members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lackof foresight, and in the other case for its pitiless foresight; and toseize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess, a default ofwork and an excess of punishment.Whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely thoseof its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goodsmade by chance, and consequently the most deserving of consideration.These questions put and answered, he judged society and condemned it.He condemned it to his hatred.He made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering, and he saidto himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to callit to account.', 'He declared to himself that there was no equilibriumbetween the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being doneto him; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment wasnot, in truth, unjust, but that it most assuredly was iniquitous.Anger may be both foolish and absurd; one can be irritated wrongfully;one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one’s sideat bottom.', 'Jean Valjean felt himself exasperated.And besides, human society had done him nothing but harm; he had neverseen anything of it save that angry face which it calls Justice, andwhich it shows to those whom it strikes.', 'Men had only touched him tobruise him.', 'Every contact with them had been a blow.', 'Never, since hisinfancy, since the days of his mother, of his sister, had he everencountered a friendly word and a kindly glance.', 'From suffering tosuffering, he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is awar; and that in this war he was the conquered.', 'He had no other weaponthan his hate.', 'He resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear itaway with him when he departed.There was at Toulon a school for the convicts, kept by the Ignorantinfriars, where the most necessary branches were taught to those of theunfortunate men who had a mind for them.', 'He was of the number who had amind.', 'He went to school at the age of forty, and learned to read, towrite, to cipher.', 'He felt that to fortify his intelligence was tofortify his hate.', 'In certain cases, education and enlightenment canserve to eke out evil.This is a sad thing to say; after having judged society, which hadcaused his unhappiness, he judged Providence, which had made society,and he condemned it also.Thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery, this soul mountedand at the same time fell.', 'Light entered it on one side, and darknesson the other.Jean Valjean had not, as we have seen, an evil nature.', 'He was stillgood when he arrived at the galleys.', 'He there condemned society, andfelt that he was becoming wicked; he there condemned Providence, andwas conscious that he was becoming impious.It is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point.Does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom?', 'Can theman created good by God be rendered wicked by man?', 'Can the soul becompletely made over by fate, and become evil, fate being evil?', 'Can theheart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities andinfirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness, asthe vertebral column beneath too low a vault?', 'Is there not in everyhuman soul, was there not in the soul of Jean Valjean in particular, afirst spark, a divine element, incorruptible in this world, immortal inthe other, which good can develop, fan, ignite, and make to glow withsplendor, and which evil can never wholly extinguish?Grave and obscure questions, to the last of which every physiologistwould probably have responded no, and that without hesitation, had hebeheld at Toulon, during the hours of repose, which were for JeanValjean hours of reverie, this gloomy galley-slave, seated with foldedarms upon the bar of some capstan, with the end of his chain thrustinto his pocket to prevent its dragging, serious, silent, andthoughtful, a pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath,condemned by civilization, and regarding heaven with severity.Certainly,—and we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact,—theobserving physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery; hewould, perchance, have pitied this sick man, of the law’s making; buthe would not have even essayed any treatment; he would have turnedaside his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpsewithin this soul, and, like Dante at the portals of hell, he would haveeffaced from this existence the word which the finger of God has,nevertheless, inscribed upon the brow of every man,—hope.Was this state of his soul, which we have attempted to analyze, asperfectly clear to Jean Valjean as we have tried to render it for thosewho read us?', 'Did Jean Valjean distinctly perceive, after theirformation, and had he seen distinctly during the process of theirformation, all the elements of which his moral misery was composed?', 'Hadthis rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception ofthe succession of ideas through which he had, by degrees, mounted anddescended to the lugubrious aspects which had, for so many years,formed the inner horizon of his spirit?', 'Was he conscious of all thatpassed within him, and of all that was working there?', 'That is somethingwhich we do not presume to state; it is something which we do not evenbelieve.', 'There was too much ignorance in Jean Valjean, even after hismisfortune, to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there.', 'Attimes he did not rightly know himself what he felt.', 'Jean Valjean was inthe shadows; he suffered in the shadows; he hated in the shadows; onemight have said that he hated in advance of himself.', 'He dwelthabitually in this shadow, feeling his way like a blind man and adreamer.', 'Only, at intervals, there suddenly came to him, from withoutand from within, an access of wrath, a surcharge of suffering, a lividand rapid flash which illuminated his whole soul, and caused to appearabruptly all around him, in front, behind, amid the gleams of afrightful light, the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective ofhis destiny.The flash passed, the night closed in again; and where was he?', 'He nolonger knew.', 'The peculiarity of pains of this nature, in which thatwhich is pitiless—that is to say, that which isbrutalizing—predominates, is to transform a man, little by little, by asort of stupid transfiguration, into a wild beast; sometimes into aferocious beast.Jean Valjean’s successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alonesuffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul.Jean Valjean would have renewed these attempts, utterly useless andfoolish as they were, as often as the opportunity had presented itself,without reflecting for an instant on the result, nor on the experienceswhich he had already gone through.', 'He escaped impetuously, like thewolf who finds his cage open.', 'Instinct said to him, “Flee!” Reasonwould have said, “Remain!” But in the presence of so violent atemptation, reason vanished; nothing remained but instinct.', 'The beastalone acted.', 'When he was recaptured, the fresh severities inflicted onhim only served to render him still more wild.One detail, which we must not omit, is that he possessed a physicalstrength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens ofthe galleys.', 'At work, at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan,Jean Valjean was worth four men.', 'He sometimes lifted and sustainedenormous weights on his back; and when the occasion demanded it, hereplaced that implement which is called a jack-screw, and was formerlycalled _orgueil_ [pride], whence, we may remark in passing, is derivedthe name of the Rue Montorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] in Paris.His comrades had nicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw.', 'Once, when theywere repairing the balcony of the town-hall at Toulon, one of thoseadmirable caryatids of Puget, which support the balcony, becameloosened, and was on the point of falling.', 'Jean Valjean, who waspresent, supported the caryatid with his shoulder, and gave the workmentime to arrive.His suppleness even exceeded his strength.', 'Certain convicts who wereforever dreaming of escape, ended by making a veritable science offorce and skill combined.', 'It is the science of muscles.', 'An entiresystem of mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners, men whoare forever envious of the flies and birds.', 'To climb a verticalsurface, and to find points of support where hardly a projection wasvisible, was play to Jean Valjean.', 'An angle of the wall being given,with the tension of his back and legs, with his elbows and his heelsfitted into the unevenness of the stone, he raised himself as if bymagic to the third story.', 'He sometimes mounted thus even to the roof ofthe galley prison.He spoke but little.', 'He laughed not at all.', 'An excessive emotion wasrequired to wring from him, once or twice a year, that lugubrious laughof the convict, which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon.', 'To allappearance, he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation ofsomething terrible.He was absorbed, in fact.Athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushedintelligence, he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing wasresting on him.', 'In that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled,each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance, heperceived with terror, mingled with rage, a sort of frightfulaccumulation of things, collecting and mounting above him, beyond therange of his vision,—laws, prejudices, men, and deeds,—whose outlinesescaped him, whose mass terrified him, and which was nothing else thanthat prodigious pyramid which we call civilization.', 'He distinguished,here and there in that swarming and formless mass, now near him, nowafar off and on inaccessible table-lands, some group, some detail,vividly illuminated; here the galley-sergeant and his cudgel; there thegendarme and his sword; yonder the mitred archbishop; away at the top,like a sort of sun, the Emperor, crowned and dazzling.', 'It seemed to himthat these distant splendors, far from dissipating his night, renderedit more funereal and more black.', 'All this—laws, prejudices, deeds, men,things—went and came above him, over his head, in accordance with thecomplicated and mysterious movement which God imparts to civilization,walking over him and crushing him with I know not what peacefulness inits cruelty and inexorability in its indifference.', 'Souls which havefallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune, unhappy men lost inthe lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks, thereproved of the law, feel the whole weight of this human society, soformidable for him who is without, so frightful for him who is beneath,resting upon their heads.In this situation Jean Valjean meditated; and what could be the natureof his meditation?If the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts, it would,doubtless, think that same thing which Jean Valjean thought.All these things, realities full of spectres, phantasmagories full ofrealities, had eventually created for him a sort of interior statewhich is almost indescribable.At times, amid his convict toil, he paused.', 'He fell to thinking.', 'Hisreason, at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore,rose in revolt.', 'Everything which had happened to him seemed to himabsurd;

secondly, of evil action which was serious, grave,consciously argued out and premeditated, with the false ideas whichsuch a misfortune can furnish.', 'His deliberate deeds passed throughthree successive phases, which natures of a certain stamp can alonetraverse,—reasoning, will, perseverance.', 'He had for moving causes hishabitual wrath, bitterness of soul, a profound sense of indignitiessuffered, the reaction even against the good, the innocent, and thejust, if there are any such.', 'The point of departure, like the point ofarrival, for all his thoughts, was hatred of human law;

thenhe closed them again, with the intention of going to sleep once more.When many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matterspreoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, but not a second time.', 'Sleepcomes more easily than it returns.', 'This is what happened to JeanValjean.', 'He could not get to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one’smind are troubled.', 'There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain.', 'Hismemories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated therepell-mell and mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becomingdisproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy andperturbed pool.', 'Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one whichkept constantly presenting itself afresh, and which drove away allothers.', 'We will mention this thought at once: he had observed the sixsets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame Magloire hadplaced on the table.Those six sets of silver haunted him.—They were there.—A few pacesdistant.—Just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the onein which he then was, the old servant-woman had been in the act ofplacing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed.—He hadtaken careful note of this cupboard.—On the right, as you entered fromthe dining-room.—They were solid.—And old silver.—From the ladle onecould get at least two hundred francs.—Double what he had earned innineteen years.—It is true that he would have earned more if “the_administration_ had not _robbed him_.”His mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there wascertainly mingled some struggle.', 'Three o’clock struck.', 'He opened hiseyes again, drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture, stretchedout his arm and felt of his knapsack, which he had thrown down on acorner of the alcove; then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed,and placed his feet on the floor, and thus found himself, almostwithout knowing it, seated on his bed.He remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which would havebeen suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him thusin the dark, the only person awake in that house where all weresleeping.', 'All of a sudden he stooped down, removed his shoes and placedthem softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtfulattitude, and became motionless once more.Throughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have aboveindicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, withdrew,re-entered, and in a manner oppressed him; and then he thought, also,without knowing why, and with the mechanical persistence of reverie, ofa convict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, and whosetrousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton.', 'Thecheckered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind.He remained in this situation, and would have so remained indefinitely,even until daybreak, had not the clock struck one—the half or quarterhour.', 'It seemed to him that that stroke said to him, “Come on!”He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; allwas quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with shortsteps, to the window, of which he caught a glimpse.', 'The night was notvery dark; there was a full moon, across which coursed large cloudsdriven by the wind.', 'This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleamsof light, eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors asort of twilight.', 'This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to seehis way, intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort oflivid light which falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before whichthe passers-by come and go.', 'On arriving at the window, Jean Valjeanexamined it.', 'It had no grating; it opened in the garden and wasfastened, according to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin.He opened it; but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated theroom abruptly, he closed it again immediately.', 'He scrutinized thegarden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks.', 'Thegarden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall, easy to climb.', 'Faraway, at the extremity, he perceived tops of trees, spaced at regularintervals, which indicated that the wall separated the garden from anavenue or lane planted with trees.Having taken this survey, he executed a movement like that of a man whohas made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack,opened it, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed onthe bed, put his shoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole thing upagain, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap, drew thevisor down over his eyes, felt for his cudgel, went and placed it inthe angle of the window; then returned to the bed, and resolutelyseized the object which he had deposited there.', 'It resembled a shortbar of iron, pointed like a pike at one end.', 'It would have beendifficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bitof iron could have been designed.', 'Perhaps it was a lever; possibly itwas a club.In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothingmore than a miner’s candlestick.', 'Convicts were, at that period,sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills whichenviron Toulon, and it was not rare for them to have miners’ tools attheir command.', 'These miners’ candlesticks are of massive iron,terminated at the lower extremity by a point, by means of which theyare stuck into the rock.He took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath andtrying to deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps to thedoor of the adjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as we already know.On arriving at this door, he found it ajar.', 'The Bishop had not closedit.CHAPTER XI—WHAT HE DOESJean Valjean listened.', 'Not a sound.He gave the door a push.He pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with thefurtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering.The door yielded to this pressure, and made an imperceptible and silentmovement, which enlarged the opening a little.He waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder push.It continued to yield in silence.', 'The opening was now large enough toallow him to pass.', 'But near the door there stood a little table, whichformed an embarrassing angle with it, and barred the entrance.Jean Valjean recognized the difficulty.', 'It was necessary, at any cost,to enlarge the aperture still further.He decided on his course of action, and gave the door a third push,more energetic than the two preceding.', 'This time a badly oiled hingesuddenly emitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry.Jean Valjean shuddered.', 'The noise of the hinge rang in his ears withsomething of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Dayof Judgment.In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imaginedthat that hinge had just become animated, and had suddenly assumed aterrible life, and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one,and warn and to wake those who were asleep.', 'He halted, shuddering,bewildered, and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels.', 'Heheard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers, andit seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roarof the wind issuing from a cavern.', 'It seemed impossible to him that thehorrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed theentire household, like the shock of an earthquake; the door, pushed byhim, had taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise atonce; the two old women would shriek out; people would come to theirassistance; in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in anuproar, and the gendarmerie on hand.', 'For a moment he thought himselflost.He remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, not daringto make a movement.', 'Several minutes elapsed.', 'The door had fallen wideopen.', 'He ventured to peep into the next room.', 'Nothing had stirredthere.', 'He lent an ear.', 'Nothing was moving in the house.', 'The noise madeby the rusty hinge had not awakened any one.This first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful tumultwithin him.', 'Nevertheless, he did not retreat.', 'Even when he had thoughthimself lost, he had not drawn back.', 'His only thought now was to finishas soon as possible.', 'He took a step and entered the room.This room was in a state of perfect calm.', 'Here and there vague andconfused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were papersscattered on a table, open folios, volumes piled upon a stool, anarmchair heaped with clothing, a prie-Dieu, and which at that hour wereonly shadowy corners and whitish spots.', 'Jean Valjean advanced withprecaution, taking care not to knock against the furniture.', 'He couldhear, at the extremity of the room, the even and tranquil breathing ofthe sleeping Bishop.He suddenly came to a halt.', 'He was near the bed.', 'He had arrived theresooner than he had thought for.Nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with ouractions with sombre and intelligent appropriateness, as though shedesired to make us reflect.', 'For the last half-hour a large cloud hadcovered the heavens.', 'At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front ofthe bed, this cloud parted, as though on purpose, and a ray of light,traversing the long window, suddenly illuminated the Bishop’s paleface.', 'He was sleeping peacefully.', 'He lay in his bed almost completelydressed, on account of the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment ofbrown wool, which covered his arms to the wrists.', 'His head was thrownback on the pillow, in the careless attitude of repose; his hand,adorned with the pastoral ring, and whence had fallen so many gooddeeds and so many holy actions, was hanging over the edge of the bed.His whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction,of hope, and of felicity.', 'It was more than a smile, and almost aradiance.', 'He bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a lightwhich was invisible.', 'The soul of the just contemplates in sleep amysterious heaven.A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.It was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that heaven waswithin him.', 'That heaven was his conscience.', 'Enlarge1b2-10-the-fallTH (58K)At the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, so to speak,upon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory.', 'Itremained, however, gentle and veiled in an ineffable half-light.', 'Thatmoon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver,that house which was so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, addedsome solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of thisman, and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that whitehair, those closed eyes, that face in which all was hope and all wasconfidence, that head of an old man, and that slumber of an infant.There was something almost divine in this man, who was thus august,without being himself aware of it.Jean Valjean was in the shadow, and stood motionless, with his ironcandlestick in his hand, frightened by this luminous old man.', 'Never hadhe beheld anything like this.', 'This confidence terrified him.', 'The moralworld has no grander spectacle than this: a troubled and uneasyconscience, which has arrived on the brink of an evil action,contemplating the slumber of the just.That slumber in that isolation, and with a neighbor like himself, hadabout it something sublime, of which he was vaguely but imperiouslyconscious.No one could have told what was passing within him, not even himself.In order to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary to think ofthe most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle.', 'Even onhis visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything withcertainty.', 'It was a sort of haggard astonishment.', 'He gazed at it, andthat was all.', 'But what was his thought?', 'It would have been impossibleto divine it.', 'What was evident was, that he was touched and astounded.But what was the nature of this emotion?His eye never quitted the old man.', 'The only thing which was clearly tobe inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strangeindecision.', 'One would have said that he was hesitating between the twoabysses,—the one in which one loses one’s self and that in which onesaves one’s self.', 'He seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kissthat hand.At the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards hisbrow, and he took off his cap; then his arm fell back with the samedeliberation, and Jean Valjean fell to meditating once more, his cap inhis left hand, his club in his right hand, his hair bristling all overhis savage head.The Bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifyinggaze.The gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over thechimney-piece, which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them,with a benediction for one and pardon for the other.Suddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow; then steppedrapidly past the bed, without glancing at the Bishop, straight to thecupboard, which he saw near the head; he raised his iron candlestick asthough to force the lock; the key was there; he opened it; the firstthing which presented itself to him was the basket of silverware; heseized it, traversed the chamber with long strides, without taking anyprecautions and without troubling himself about the noise, gained thedoor, re-entered the oratory, opened the window, seized his cudgel,bestrode the window-sill of the ground floor, put the silver into hisknapsack, threw away the basket, crossed the garden, leaped over thewall like a tiger, and fled.CHAPTER XII—THE BISHOP WORKSThe next morning at sunrise Monseigneur Bienvenu was strolling in hisgarden.', 'Madame Magloire ran up to him in utter consternation.“Monseigneur, Monseigneur!” she exclaimed, “does your Grace know wherethe basket of silver is?”“Yes,” replied the Bishop.“Jesus the Lord be blessed!” she resumed; “I did not know what hadbecome of it.”The Bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower-bed.', 'He presentedit to Madame Magloire.“Here it is.”“Well!” said she.', '“Nothing in it!', 'And the silver?”“Ah,” returned the Bishop, “so it is the silver which troubles you?', 'Idon’t know where it is.”“Great, good God!', 'It is stolen!', 'That man who was here last night hasstolen it.”In a twinkling, with all the vivacity of an alert old woman, MadameMagloire had rushed to the oratory, entered the alcove, and returned tothe Bishop.', 'The Bishop had just bent down, and was sighing as heexamined a plant of cochlearia des Guillons, which the basket hadbroken as it fell across the bed.', 'He rose up at Madame Magloire’s cry.“Monseigneur, the man is gone!', 'The silver has been stolen!”As she uttered this exclamation, her eyes fell upon a corner of thegarden, where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible.', 'Thecoping of the wall had been torn away.“Stay!', 'yonder is the way he went.', 'He jumped over into Cochefilet Lane.Ah, the abomination!', 'He has stolen our silver!”The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he raised his grave eyes,and said gently to Madame Magloire:—“And, in the first place, was that silver ours?”Madame Magloire was speechless.', 'Another silence ensued; then the Bishopwent on:—“Madame Magloire, I have for a long time detained that silverwrongfully.', 'It belonged to the poor.', 'Who was that man?', 'A poor man,evidently.”“Alas!', 'Jesus!” returned Madame Magloire.', '“It is not for my sake, norfor Mademoiselle’s.', 'It makes no difference to us.', 'But it is for thesake of Monseigneur.', 'What is Monseigneur to eat with now?”The Bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement.“Ah, come!', 'Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons?”Madame Magloire shrugged her shoulders.“Pewter has an odor.”“Iron forks and spoons, then.”Madame Magloire made an expressive grimace.“Iron has a taste.”“Very well,” said the Bishop; “wooden ones then.”A few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which JeanValjean had sat on the previous evening.', 'As he ate his breakfast,Monseigneur Welcome remarked gayly to his sister, who said nothing, andto Madame Magloire, who was grumbling under her breath, that one reallydoes not need either fork or spoon, even of wood, in order to dip a bitof bread in a cup of milk.“A pretty idea, truly,” said Madame Magloire to herself, as she wentand came, “to take in a man like that!', 'and to lodge him close to one’sself!', 'And how fortunate that he did nothing but steal!', 'Ah, mon Dieu!', 'itmakes one shudder to think of it!”As the brother and sister were about to rise from the table, there camea knock at the door.“Come in,” said the Bishop.The door opened.', 'A singular and violent group made its appearance onthe threshold.', 'Three men were holding a fourth man by the collar.', 'Thethree men were gendarmes; the other was Jean Valjean.A brigadier of gendarmes, who seemed to be in command of the group, wasstanding near the door.', 'He entered and advanced to the Bishop, making amilitary salute.“Monseigneur—” said he.At this word, Jean Valjean, who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed,raised his head with an air of stupefaction.“Monseigneur!” he murmured.', '“So he is not the curé?”“Silence!” said the gendarme.', '“He is Monseigneur the Bishop.”In the meantime, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advanced as quickly as hisgreat age permitted.“Ah!', 'here you are!” he exclaimed, looking at Jean Valjean.', '“I am gladto see you.', 'Well, but how is this?', 'I gave you the candlesticks too,which are of silver like the rest, and for which you can certainly gettwo hundred francs.', 'Why did you not carry them away with your forks andspoons?”Jean Valjean opened his eyes wide, and stared at the venerable Bishopwith an expression which no human tongue can render any account of.“Monseigneur,” said the brigadier of gendarmes, “so what this man saidis true, then?', 'We came across him.', 'He was walking like a man who isrunning away.', 'We stopped him to look into the matter.', 'He had thissilver—”“And he told you,” interposed the Bishop with a smile, “that it hadbeen given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he hadpassed the night?', 'I see how the matter stands.', 'And you have brought himback here?', 'It is a mistake.”“In that case,” replied the brigadier, “we can let him go?”“Certainly,” replied the Bishop.The gendarmes released Jean Valjean, who recoiled.“Is it true that I am to be released?” he said, in an almostinarticulate voice, and as though he were talking in his sleep.“Yes, thou art released; dost thou not understand?” said one of thegendarmes.“My friend,” resumed the Bishop, “before you go, here are yourcandlesticks.', 'Take them.”He stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, andbrought them to Jean Valjean.', 'The two women looked on without utteringa word, without a gesture, without a look which could disconcert theBishop.Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb.', 'He took the two candlesticksmechanically, and with a bewildered air.“Now,” said the Bishop, “go in peace.', 'By the way, when you return, myfriend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden.', 'You can alwaysenter and depart through the street door.', 'It is never fastened withanything but a latch, either by day or by night.”Then, turning to the gendarmes:—“You may retire, gentlemen.”The gendarmes retired.Jean Valjean was like a man on the point of fainting.The Bishop drew near to him, and said in a low voice:—“Do not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this moneyin becoming an honest man.”Jean Valjean, who had no recollection of ever having promised anything,remained speechless.', 'The Bishop had emphasized the words when heuttered them.', 'He resumed with solemnity:—“Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good.It is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughtsand the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.”CHAPTER XIII—LITTLE GERVAISJean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it.', 'He setout at a very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads andpaths presented themselves to him, without perceiving that he wasincessantly retracing his steps.', 'He wandered thus the whole morning,without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry.', 'He was theprey of a throng of novel sensations.', 'He was conscious of a sort ofrage;

itwould have agitated him less.', 'Although the season was tolerably faradvanced, there were still a few late flowers in the hedge-rows hereand there, whose odor as he passed through them in his march recalledto him memories of his childhood.', 'These memories were almostintolerable to him, it was so long since they had recurred to him.Unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long.As the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart thesoil from every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush upon alarge ruddy plain, which was absolutely deserted.', 'There was nothing onthe horizon except the Alps.', 'Not even the spire of a distant village.Jean Valjean might have been three leagues distant from D—— A pathwhich intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush.In the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed not alittle to render his rags terrifying to any one who might haveencountered him, a joyous sound became audible.He turned his head and saw a little Savoyard, about ten years of age,coming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, and hismarmot-box on his back.One of those gay and gentle children, who go from land to landaffording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers.Without stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time totime, and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in hishand—his whole fortune, probably.Among this money there was one forty-sou piece.The child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, andtossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that time, he had caughtwith a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand.This time the forty-sou piece escaped him, and went rolling towards thebrushwood until it reached Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean set his foot upon it.In the meantime, the child had looked after his coin and had caughtsight of him.He showed no astonishment, but walked straight up to the man.The spot was absolutely solitary.', 'As far as the eye could see there wasnot a person on the plain or on the path.', 'The only sound was the tiny,feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage, which was traversing theheavens at an immense height.', 'The child was standing with his back tothe sun, which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with itsblood-red gleam the savage face of Jean Valjean.“Sir,” said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidence which iscomposed of ignorance and innocence, “my money.”“What is your name?” said Jean Valjean.“Little Gervais, sir.”“Go away,” said Jean Valjean.“Sir,” resumed the child, “give me back my money.”Jean Valjean dropped his head, and made no reply.The child began again, “My money, sir.”Jean Valjean’s eyes remained fixed on the earth.“My piece of money!” cried the child, “my white piece!', 'my silver!”It seemed as though Jean Valjean did not hear him.', 'The child graspedhim by the collar of his blouse and shook him.', 'At the same time he madean effort to displace the big iron-shod shoe which rested on histreasure.“I want my piece of money!', 'my piece of forty sous!”The child wept.', 'Jean Valjean raised his head.', 'He still remained seated.His eyes were troubled.', 'He gazed at the child, in a sort of amazement,then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in aterrible voice, “Who’s there?”“I, sir,” replied the child.', '“Little Gervais!', 'I!', 'Give me back my fortysous, if you please!', 'Take your foot away, sir, if you please!”Then irritated, though he was so small, and becoming almost menacing:—“Come now, will you take your foot away?', 'Take your foot away, or we’llsee!”“Ah!', 'It’s still you!” said Jean Valjean, and rising abruptly to hisfeet, his foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:—“Will you take yourself off!”The frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble from head tofoot, and after a few moments of stupor he set out, running at the topof his speed, without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry.Nevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certaindistance, and Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of his ownreverie.At the end of a few moments the child had disappeared.The sun had set.The shadows were descending around Jean Valjean.', 'He had eaten nothingall day; it is probable that he was feverish.He had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after thechild’s flight.', 'The breath heaved his chest at long and irregularintervals.', 'His gaze, fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him, seemedto be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancientfragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass.', 'All at oncehe shivered; he had just begun to feel the chill of evening.He settled his cap more firmly on his brow, sought mechanically tocross and button his blouse, advanced a step and stopped to pick up hiscudgel.At that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which his foothad half ground into the earth, and which was shining among thepebbles.', 'It was as though he had received a galvanic shock.', '“What isthis?” he muttered between his teeth.', 'He recoiled three paces, thenhalted, without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which hisfoot had trodden but an instant before, as though the thing which layglittering there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him.At the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards thesilver coin, seized it, and straightened himself up again and began togaze afar off over the plain, at the same time casting his eyes towardsall points of the horizon, as he stood there erect and shivering, likea terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge.He saw nothing.', 'Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, greatbanks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight.He said, “Ah!” and set out rapidly in the direction in which the childhad disappeared.', 'After about thirty paces he paused, looked about himand saw nothing.Then he shouted with all his might:—“Little Gervais!', 'Little Gervais!”He paused and waited.There was no reply.The landscape was gloomy and deserted.', 'He was encompassed by space.There was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze waslost, and a silence which engulfed his voice.An icy north wind was blowing, and imparted to things around him a sortof lugubrious life.', 'The bushes shook their thin little arms withincredible fury.', 'One would have said that they were threatening andpursuing some one.He set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from time totime he halted and shouted into that solitude, with a voice which wasthe most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible tohear, “Little Gervais!', 'Little Gervais!”Assuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been alarmed andwould have taken good care not to show himself.', 'But the child was nodoubt already far away.He encountered a priest on horseback.', 'He stepped up to him and said:—“Monsieur le Curé, have you seen a child pass?”“No,” said the priest.“One named Little Gervais?”“I have seen no one.”He drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to thepriest.“Monsieur le Curé, this is for your poor people.', 'Monsieur le Curé, hewas a little lad, about ten years old, with a marmot, I think, and ahurdy-gurdy.', 'One of those Savoyards, you know?”“I have not seen him.”“Little Gervais?', 'There are no villages here?', 'Can you tell me?”“If he is like what you say, my friend, he is a little stranger.', 'Suchpersons pass through these parts.', 'We know nothing of them.”Jean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence,and gave them to the priest.“For your poor,” he said.Then he added, wildly:—“Monsieur l’Abbé, have me arrested.', 'I am a thief.”The priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste, much alarmed.Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had firsttaken.In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling,shouting, but he met no one.', 'Two or three times he ran across the plaintowards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human beingreclining or crouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwoodor rocks nearly on a level with the earth.', 'At length, at a spot wherethree paths intersected each other, he stopped.', 'The moon had risen.', 'Hesent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, “LittleGervais!', 'Little Gervais!', 'Little Gervais!” His shout died away in themist, without even awakening an echo.', 'He murmured yet once more,“Little Gervais!” but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice.', 'It washis last effort; his legs gave way abruptly under him, as though aninvisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of hisevil conscience; he fell exhausted, on a large stone, his fistsclenched in his hair and his face on his knees, and he cried, “I am awretch!”Then his heart burst, and he began to cry.', 'It was the first time thathe had wept in nineteen years.When Jean Valjean left the Bishop’s house, he was, as we have seen,quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto.', 'Hecould not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him.', 'Hehardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of theold man.', '“You have promised me to become an honest man.', 'I buy yoursoul.', 'I take it away from the spirit of perversity; I give it to thegood God.”This recurred to his mind unceasingly.', 'To this celestial kindness heopposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us.', 'He wasindistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatestassault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet; thathis obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency; that ifhe yielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which theactions of other men had filled his soul through so many years, andwhich pleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or to beconquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, had beenbegun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who isintoxicated.', 'As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have adistinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure atD——?', 'Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn orimportune the spirit at certain moments of life?', 'Did a voice whisper inhis ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; thatthere no longer remained a middle course for him; that if he were nothenceforth the best of men, he would be the worst; that it behooved himnow, so to speak, to mount higher than the Bishop, or fall lower thanthe convict; that if he wished to become good he must become an angel;that if he wished to remain evil, he must become a monster?Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put toourselves elsewhere: did he catch some shadow of all this in histhought, in a confused way?', 'Misfortune certainly, as we have said, doesform the education of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtfulwhether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we havehere indicated.', 'If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpsesof, rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him intoan unutterable and almost painful state of emotion.', 'On emerging fromthat black and deformed thing which is called the galleys, the Bishophad hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes onemerging from the dark.', 'The future life, the possible life whichoffered itself to him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him withtremors and anxiety.', 'He no longer knew where he really was.', 'Like anowl, who should suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzledand blinded, as it were, by virtue.That which was certain, that which he did not doubt, was that he was nolonger the same man, that everything about him was changed, that it wasno longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spokento him and had not touched him.In this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, and had robbedhim of his forty sous.', 'Why?', 'He certainly could not have explained it;was this the last effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of theevil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys,—a remnant ofimpulse, a result of what is called in statics, _acquired force?_ Itwas that, and it was also, perhaps, even less than that.', 'Let us say itsimply, it was not he who stole; it was not the man; it was the beast,who, by habit and instinct, had simply placed his foot upon that money,while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hithertounheard-of thoughts besetting it.When intelligence reawakened and beheld that action of the brute, JeanValjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror.', 'EnlargeAwakened  1b2-11-awakenedIt was because,—strange phenomenon, and one which was possible only inthe situation in which he found himself,—in stealing the money fromthat child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable.However that may be, this last evil action had a decisive effect onhim; it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind, anddispersed it, placed on one side the thick obscurity, and on the otherthe light, and acted on his soul, in the state in which it then was, ascertain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitatingone element and clarifying the other.First of all, even before examining himself and reflecting, allbewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to find thechild in order to return his money to him; then, when he recognized thefact that this was impossible, he halted in despair.', 'At the moment whenhe exclaimed “I am a wretch!” he had just perceived what he was, and hewas already separated from himself to such a degree, that he seemed tohimself to be no longer anything more than a phantom, and as if he had,there before him, in flesh and blood, the hideous galley-convict, JeanValjean, cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, his knapsack filledwith stolen objects on his back, with his resolute and gloomy visage,with his thoughts filled with abominable projects.Excess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in some sort avisionary.', 'This, then, was in the nature of a vision.', 'He actually sawthat Jean Valjean, that sinister face, before him.', 'He had almostreached the point of asking himself who that man was, and he washorrified by him.His brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calmmoments in which reverie is so profound that it absorbs reality.', 'One nolonger beholds the object which one has before one, and one sees, asthough apart from one’s self, the figures which one has in one’s ownmind.Thus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and at thesame time, athwart this hallucination, he perceived in a mysteriousdepth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch.', 'Onscrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with moreattention, he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form andthat this torch was the Bishop.His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,—theBishop and Jean Valjean.', 'Nothing less than the first was required tosoften the second.', 'By one of those singular effects, which are peculiarto this sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his reverie continued, asthe Bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes, so did Jean Valjeangrow less and vanish.', 'After a certain time he was no longer anythingmore than a shade.', 'All at once he disappeared.', 'The Bishop aloneremained;

and the lover who had borne the name of Adolph in thefirst chapter had turned out to be Alphonse in the second, and Gustavein the third.', 'Poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors; onescolds and the other flatters, and the beautiful daughters of thepeople have both of them whispering in their ear, each on its own side.These badly guarded souls listen.', 'Hence the falls which theyaccomplish, and the stones which are thrown at them.', 'They areoverwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible.Alas!', 'what if the Jungfrau were hungry?Favourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia and Zéphine.She had had an establishment of her own very early in life.', 'Her fatherwas an old unmarried professor of mathematics, a brutal man and abraggart, who went out to give lessons in spite of his age.', 'Thisprofessor, when he was a young man, had one day seen a chambermaid’sgown catch on a fender; he had fallen in love in consequence of thisaccident.', 'The result had been Favourite.', 'She met her father from timeto time, and he bowed to her.', 'One morning an old woman with the air ofa devotee, had entered her apartments, and had said to her, “You do notknow me, Mamemoiselle?” “No.” “I am your mother.” Then the old womanopened the sideboard, and ate and drank, had a mattress which she ownedbrought in, and installed herself.', 'This cross and pious old mothernever spoke to Favourite, remained hours without uttering a word,breakfasted, dined, and supped for four, and went down to the porter’squarters for company, where she spoke ill of her daughter.It was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn Dahlia toListolier, to others perhaps, to idleness.', 'How could she make suchnails work?', 'She who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on herhands.', 'As for Zéphine, she had conquered Fameuil by her roguish andcaressing little way of saying “Yes, sir.”The young men were comrades; the young girls were friends.', 'Such lovesare always accompanied by such friendships.Goodness and philosophy are two distinct things; the proof of this isthat, after making all due allowances for these little irregularhouseholds, Favourite, Zéphine, and Dahlia were philosophical youngwomen, while Fantine was a good girl.Good!', 'some one will exclaim; and Tholomyès?', 'Solomon would reply thatlove forms a part of wisdom.', 'We will confine ourselves to saying thatthe love of Fantine was a first love, a sole love, a faithful love.She alone, of all the four, was not called “thou” by a single one ofthem.Fantine was one of those beings who blossom, so to speak, from thedregs of the people.', 'Though she had emerged from the most unfathomabledepths of social shadow, she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymousand the unknown.', 'She was born at M. sur M. Of what parents?', 'Who cansay?', 'She had never known father or mother.', 'She was called Fantine.', 'WhyFantine?', 'She had never borne any other name.', 'At the epoch of her birththe Directory still existed.', 'She had no family name; she had no family;no baptismal name; the Church no longer existed.', 'She bore the namewhich pleased the first random passer-by, who had encountered her, whena very small child, running bare-legged in the street.', 'She received thename as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when itrained.', 'She was called little Fantine.', 'No one knew more than that.', 'Thishuman creature had entered life in just this way.', 'At the age of ten,Fantine quitted the town and went to service with some farmers in theneighborhood.', 'At fifteen she came to Paris “to seek her fortune.”Fantine was beautiful, and remained pure as long as she could.', 'She wasa lovely blonde, with fine teeth.', 'She had gold and pearls for herdowry; but her gold was on her head, and her pearls were in her mouth.She worked for her living; then, still for the sake of her living,—forthe heart, also, has its hunger,—she loved.She loved Tholomyès.An amour for him; passion for her.', 'The streets of the Latin quarter,filled with throngs of students and grisettes, saw the beginning oftheir dream.', 'Fantine had long evaded Tholomyès in the mazes of the hillof the Pantheon, where so many adventurers twine and untwine, but insuch a way as constantly to encounter him again.', 'There is a way ofavoiding which resembles seeking.', 'In short, the eclogue took place.Blachevelle, Listolier, and Fameuil formed a sort of group of whichTholomyès was the head.', 'It was he who possessed the wit.Tholomyès was the antique old student; he was rich; he had an income offour thousand francs; four thousand francs!', 'a splendid scandal on MountSainte-Geneviève.', 'Tholomyès was a fast man of thirty, and badlypreserved.', 'He was wrinkled and toothless, and he had the beginning of abald spot, of which he himself said with sadness, _the skull at thirty,the knee at forty_.', 'His digestion was mediocre, and he had beenattacked by a watering in one eye.', 'But in proportion as his youthdisappeared, gayety was kindled; he replaced his teeth withbuffooneries, his hair with mirth, his health with irony, his weepingeye laughed incessantly.', 'He was dilapidated but still in flower.', 'Hisyouth, which was packing up for departure long before its time, beat aretreat in good order, bursting with laughter, and no one saw anythingbut fire.', 'He had had a piece rejected at the Vaudeville.', 'He made a fewverses now and then.', 'In addition to this he doubted everything to thelast degree, which is a vast force in the eyes of the weak.', 'Being thusironical and bald, he was the leader.', '_Iron_ is an English word.', 'Is itpossible that irony is derived from it?One day Tholomyès took the three others aside, with the gesture of anoracle, and said to them:—“Fantine, Dahlia, Zéphine, and Favourite have been teasing us fornearly a year to give them a surprise.', 'We have promised them solemnlythat we would.', 'They are forever talking about it to us, to me inparticular, just as the old women in Naples cry to Saint Januarius,‘_Faccia gialluta, fa o miracolo_, Yellow face, perform thy miracle,’so our beauties say to me incessantly, ‘Tholomyès, when will you bringforth your surprise?’ At the same time our parents keep writing to us.Pressure on both sides.', 'The moment has arrived, it seems to me; let usdiscuss the question.”Thereupon, Tholomyès lowered his voice and articulated something somirthful, that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the fourmouths simultaneously, and Blachevelle exclaimed, “That is an idea.”A smoky tap-room presented itself; they entered, and the remainder oftheir confidential colloquy was lost in shadow.The result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which tookplace on the following Sunday, the four young men inviting the fouryoung girls.CHAPTER III—FOUR AND FOURIt is hard nowadays to picture to one’s self what a pleasure-trip ofstudents and grisettes to the country was like, forty-five years ago.The suburbs of Paris are no longer the same; the physiognomy of whatmay be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the lasthalf-century; where there was the cuckoo, there is the railway car;where there was a tender-boat, there is now the steamboat; people speakof Fécamp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days.', 'TheParis of 1862 is a city which has France for its outskirts.The four couples conscientiously went through with all the countryfollies possible at that time.', 'The vacation was beginning, and it was awarm, bright, summer day.', 'On the preceding day, Favourite, the only onewho knew how to write, had written the following to Tholomyès in thename of the four: “It is a good hour to emerge from happiness.” That iswhy they rose at five o’clock in the morning.', 'Then they went toSaint-Cloud by the coach, looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed,“This must be very beautiful when there is water!” They breakfasted atthe _Tête-Noir_, where Castaing had not yet been; they treatedthemselves to a game of ring-throwing under the quincunx of trees ofthe grand fountain; they ascended Diogenes’ lantern, they gambled formacaroons at the roulette establishment of the Pont de Sèvres, pickedbouquets at Pateaux, bought reed-pipes at Neuilly, ate apple tartseverywhere, and were perfectly happy.The young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from theircage.', 'It was a perfect delirium.', 'From time to time they bestowed littletaps on the young men.', 'Matutinal intoxication of life!', 'adorable years!the wings of the dragonfly quiver.', 'Oh, whoever you may be, do you notremember?', 'Have you rambled through the brushwood, holding aside thebranches, on account of the charming head which is coming on behindyou?', 'Have you slid, laughing, down a slope all wet with rain, with abeloved woman holding your hand, and crying, “Ah, my new boots!', 'what astate they are in!”Let us say at once that that merry obstacle, a shower, was lacking inthe case of this good-humored party, although Favourite had said asthey set out, with a magisterial and maternal tone, _“The slugs arecrawling in the paths,—a sign of rain, children.”_All four were madly pretty.', 'A good old classic poet, then famous, agood fellow who had an Éléonore, M. le Chevalier de Labouisse, as hestrolled that day beneath the chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud, saw thempass about ten o’clock in the morning, and exclaimed, “There is one toomany of them,” as he thought of the Graces.', 'Favourite, Blachevelle’sfriend, the one aged three and twenty, the old one, ran on in frontunder the great green boughs, jumped the ditches, stalked distractedlyover bushes, and presided over this merry-making with the spirit of ayoung female faun.', 'Zéphine and Dahlia, whom chance had made beautifulin such a way that they set each off when they were together, andcompleted each other, never left each other, more from an instinct ofcoquetry than from friendship, and clinging to each other, they assumedEnglish poses; the first _keepsakes_ had just made their appearance,melancholy was dawning for women, as later on, Byronism dawned for men;and the hair of the tender sex began to droop dolefully.', 'Zéphine andDahlia had their hair dressed in rolls.', 'Listolier and Fameuil, who wereengaged in discussing their professors, explained to Fantine thedifference that existed between M. Delvincourt and M. Blondeau.Blachevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry Favourite’ssingle-bordered, imitation India shawl of Ternaux’s manufacture, on hisarm on Sundays.Tholomyès followed, dominating the group.', 'He was very gay, but one feltthe force of government in him; there was dictation in his joviality;his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg patternof nankeen, with straps of braided copper wire; he carried a stoutrattan worth two hundred francs in his hand, and, as he treated himselfto everything, a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth.', 'Nothing wassacred to him; he smoked.“That Tholomyès is astounding!” said the others, with veneration.', '“Whattrousers!', 'What energy!”As for Fantine, she was a joy to behold.', 'Her splendid teeth hadevidently received an office from God,—laughter.', 'She preferred to carryher little hat of sewed straw, with its long white strings, in her handrather than on her head.', 'Her thick blond hair, which was inclined towave, and which easily uncoiled, and which it was necessary to fastenup incessantly, seemed made for the flight of Galatea under thewillows.', 'Her rosy lips babbled enchantingly.', 'The corners of her mouthvoluptuously turned up, as in the antique masks of Erigone, had an airof encouraging the audacious; but her long, shadowy lashes droopeddiscreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though tocall a halt.', 'There was something indescribably harmonious and strikingabout her entire dress.', 'She wore a gown of mauve barège, little reddishbrown buskins, whose ribbons traced an X on her fine, white,open-worked stockings, and that sort of muslin spencer, a Marseillesinvention, whose name, _canezou_, a corruption of the words _quinzeaoût_, pronounced after the fashion of the Canebière, signifies fineweather, heat, and midday.', 'The three others, less timid, as we havealready said, wore low-necked dresses without disguise, which insummer, beneath flower-adorned hats, are very graceful and enticing;but by the side of these audacious outfits, blond Fantine’s _canezou_,with its transparencies, its indiscretion, and its reticence,concealing and displaying at one and the same time, seemed an alluringgodsend of decency, and the famous Court of Love, presided over by theVicomtesse de Cette, with the sea-green eyes, would, perhaps, haveawarded the prize for coquetry to this _canezou_, in the contest forthe prize of modesty.', 'The most ingenious is, at times, the wisest.', 'Thisdoes happen.Brilliant of face, delicate of profile, with eyes of a deep blue, heavylids, feet arched and small, wrists and ankles admirably formed, awhite skin which, here and there allowed the azure branching of theveins to be seen, joy, a cheek that was young and fresh, the robustthroat of the Juno of Ægina, a strong and supple nape of the neck,shoulders modelled as though by Coustou, with a voluptuous dimple inthe middle, visible through the muslin; a gayety cooled by dreaminess;sculptural and exquisite—such was Fantine; and beneath these feminineadornments and these ribbons one could divine a statue, and in thatstatue a soul.Fantine was beautiful, without being too conscious of it.', 'Those raredreamers, mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confronteverything with perfection, would have caught a glimpse in this littleworking-woman, through the transparency of her Parisian grace, of theancient sacred euphony.', 'This daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred.She was beautiful in the two ways—style and rhythm.', 'Style is the formof the ideal; rhythm is its movement.We have said that Fantine was joy; she was also modesty.To an observer who studied her attentively, that which breathed fromher athwart all the intoxication of her age, the season, and her loveaffair, was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty.', 'Sheremained a little astonished.', 'This chaste astonishment is the shade ofdifference which separates Psyche from Venus.', 'Fantine had the long,white, fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of thesacred fire with a golden pin.', 'Although she would have refused nothingto Tholomyès, as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see, herface in repose was supremely virginal; a sort of serious and almostaustere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times, and therewas nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become sosuddenly extinct there, and meditation succeed to cheerfulness withoutany transition state.', 'This sudden and sometimes severely accentuatedgravity resembled the disdain of a goddess.', 'Her brow, her nose, herchin, presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinctfrom equilibrium of proportion, and from which harmony of countenanceresults; in the very characteristic interval which separates the baseof the nose from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible and charmingfold, a mysterious sign of chastity, which makes Barberousse fall inlove with a Diana found in the treasures of Iconia.Love is a fault; so be it.', 'Fantine was innocence floating high overfault.CHAPTER IV—THOLOMYÈS IS SO MERRY THAT HE SINGS A SPANISH DITTYThat day was composed of dawn, from one end to the other.', 'All natureseemed to be having a holiday, and to be laughing.', 'The flower-beds ofSaint-Cloud perfumed the air; the breath of the Seine rustled theleaves vaguely; the branches gesticulated in the wind, bees pillagedthe jasmines; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon theyarrow, the clover, and the sterile oats; in the august park of theKing of France there was a pack of vagabonds, the birds.The four merry couples, mingled with the sun, the fields, the flowers,the trees, were resplendent.And in this community of Paradise, talking, singing, running, dancing,chasing butterflies, plucking convolvulus, wetting their pink,open-work stockings in the tall grass, fresh, wild, without malice, allreceived, to some extent, the kisses of all, with the exception ofFantine, who was hedged about with that vague resistance of herscomposed of dreaminess and wildness, and who was in love.', '“You alwayshave a queer look about you,” said Favourite to her.Such things are joys.', 'These passages of happy couples are a profoundappeal to life and nature, and make a caress and light spring forthfrom everything.', 'There was once a fairy who created the fields andforests expressly for those in love,—in that eternal hedge-school oflovers, which is forever beginning anew, and which will last as long asthere are hedges and scholars.', 'Hence the popularity of spring amongthinkers.', 'The patrician and the knife-grinder, the duke and the peer,the limb of the law, the courtiers and townspeople, as they used to sayin olden times, all are subjects of this fairy.', 'They laugh and hunt,and there is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis—what atransfiguration effected by love!', 'Notaries’ clerks are gods.', 'And thelittle cries, the pursuits through the grass, the waists embraced onthe fly, those jargons which are melodies, those adorations which burstforth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable, those cherries torn fromone mouth by another,—all this blazes forth and takes its place amongthe celestial glories.', 'Beautiful women waste themselves sweetly.', 'Theythink that this will never come to an end.', 'Philosophers, poets,painters, observe these ecstasies and know not what to make of it, sogreatly are they dazzled by it.', 'The departure for Cythera!', 'exclaimsWatteau; Lancret, the painter of plebeians, contemplates his bourgeois,who have flitted away into the azure sky; Diderot stretches out hisarms to all these love idyls, and d’Urfé mingles druids with them.After breakfast the four couples went to what was then called theKing’s Square to see a newly arrived plant from India, whose nameescapes our memory at this moment, and which, at that epoch, wasattracting all Paris to Saint-Cloud.', 'It was an odd and charming shrubwith a long stem, whose numerous branches, bristling and leafless andas fine as threads, were covered with a million tiny white rosettes;this gave the shrub the air of a head of hair studded with flowers.There was always an admiring crowd about it.After viewing the shrub, Tholomyès exclaimed, “I offer you asses!” andhaving agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses, they returnedby way of Vanvres and Issy.', 'At Issy an incident occurred.', 'The trulynational park, at that time owned by Bourguin the contractor, happenedto be wide open.', 'They passed the gates, visited the manikin anchoritein his grotto, tried the mysterious little effects of the famouscabinet of mirrors, the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become amillionaire or of Turcaret metamorphosed into a Priapus.', 'They hadstoutly shaken the swing attached to the two chestnut-trees celebratedby the Abbé de Bernis.', 'As he swung these beauties, one after the other,producing folds in the fluttering skirts which Greuze would have foundto his taste, amid peals of laughter, the Toulousan Tholomyès, who wassomewhat of a Spaniard, Toulouse being the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to amelancholy chant, the old ballad _gallega_, probably inspired by somelovely maid dashing in full flight upon a rope between two trees:—“Soy de Badajoz,        “Badajoz is my home,Amor me llama,          And Love is my name;Toda mi alma,             To my eyes in flame,Es en mi ojos,              All my soul doth come;Porque enseñas,         For instruction meetA tuas piernas.', 'I receive at thy feet”Fantine alone refused to swing.“I don’t like to have people put on airs like that,” mutteredFavourite, with a good deal of acrimony.After leaving the asses there was a fresh delight; they crossed theSeine in a boat, and proceeding from Passy on foot they reached thebarrier of l‘Étoile.', 'They had been up since five o’clock that morning,as the reader will remember; but _bah!', 'there is no such thing asfatigue on Sunday_, said Favourite; _on Sunday fatigue does not work_.About three o’clock the four couples, frightened at their happiness,were sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which thenoccupied the heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line was visibleabove the trees of the Champs-Élysées.From time to time Favourite exclaimed:—“And the surprise?', 'I claim the surprise.”“Patience,” replied Tholomyès.CHAPTER V—AT BOMBARDA’SThe Russian mountains having been exhausted, they began to think aboutdinner; and the radiant party of eight, somewhat weary at last, becamestranded in Bombarda’s public house, a branch establishment which hadbeen set up in the Champs-Élysées by that famous restaurant-keeper,Bombarda, whose sign could then be seen in the Rue de Rivoli, nearDelorme Alley.A large but ugly room, with an alcove and a bed at the end (they hadbeen obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the Sundaycrowd); two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms, the quayand the river; a magnificent August sunlight lightly touching thepanes; two tables; upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets,mingled with the hats of men and women; at the other the four couplesseated round a merry confusion of platters, dishes, glasses, andbottles; jugs of beer mingled with flasks of wine; very little order onthe table, some disorder beneath it;“They made beneath the tableA noise, a clatter of the feet that was abominable,”says Molière.This was the state which the shepherd idyl, begun at five o’clock inthe morning, had reached at half-past four in the afternoon.', 'The sunwas setting; their appetites were satisfied.The Champs-Élysées, filled with sunshine and with people, were nothingbut light and dust, the two things of which glory is composed.', 'Thehorses of Marly, those neighing marbles, were prancing in a cloud ofgold.', 'Carriages were going and coming.', 'A squadron of magnificentbody-guards, with their clarions at their head, were descending theAvenue de Neuilly; the white flag, showing faintly rosy in the settingsun, floated over the dome of the Tuileries.', 'The Place de la Concorde,which had become the Place Louis XV.', 'once more, was choked with happypromenaders.', 'Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from thewhite-watered ribbon, which had not yet wholly disappeared frombutton-holes in the year 1817.', 'Here and there choruses of little girlsthrew to the winds, amid the passers-by, who formed into circles andapplauded, the then celebrated Bourbon air, which was destined tostrike the Hundred Days with lightning, and which had for its refrain:—“Rendez-nous notre père de Gand,Rendez-nous notre père.”“Give us back our father from Ghent,Give us back our father.”Groups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes evendecorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over thelarge square and the Marigny square, were playing at rings andrevolving on the wooden horses; others were engaged in drinking; somejourneyman printers had on paper caps; their laughter was audible.Everything was radiant.', 'It was a time of undisputed peace and profoundroyalist security; it was the epoch when a special and private reportof Chief of Police Anglès to the King, on the subject of the suburbs ofParis, terminated with these lines:—“Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to befeared from these people.', 'They are as heedless and as indolent as cats.The populace is restless in the provinces; it is not in Paris.', 'Theseare very pretty men, Sire.', 'It would take all of two of them to make oneof your grenadiers.', 'There is nothing to be feared on the part of thepopulace of Paris the capital.', 'It is remarkable that the stature ofthis population should have diminished in the last fifty years; and thepopulace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of theRevolution.', 'It is not dangerous.', 'In short, it is an amiable rabble.”Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transformitself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies themiracle wrought by the populace of Paris.', 'Moreover, the cat so despisedby Count Anglès possessed the esteem of the republics of old.', 'In theireyes it was liberty incarnate; and as though to serve as pendant to theMinerva Aptera of the Piræus, there stood on the public square inCorinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat.', 'The ingenuous police ofthe Restoration beheld the populace of Paris in too “rose-colored” alight; it is not so much of “an amiable rabble” as it is thought.', 'TheParisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek: no onesleeps more soundly than he, no one is more frankly frivolous and lazythan he, no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness; let him notbe trusted nevertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; butwhen there is glory at the end of it, he is worthy of admiration inevery sort of fury.', 'Give him a pike, he will produce the 10th ofAugust; give him a gun, you will have Austerlitz.', 'He is Napoleon’s stayand Danton’s resource.', 'Is it a question of country, he enlists; is it aquestion of liberty, he tears up the pavements.', 'Beware!', 'his hair filledwith wrath, is epic; his blouse drapes itself like the folds of achlamys.', 'Take care!', 'he will make of the first Rue Grenétat which comesto hand Caudine Forks.', 'When the hour strikes, this man of the faubourgswill grow in stature; this little man will arise, and his gaze will beterrible, and his breath will become a tempest, and there will issueforth from that slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds ofthe Alps.', 'It is, thanks to the suburban man of Paris, that theRevolution, mixed with arms, conquers Europe.', 'He sings; it is hisdelight.', 'Proportion his song to his nature, and you will see!', 'As longas he has for refrain nothing but _la Carmagnole_, he only overthrowsLouis XVI.', '; make him sing the _Marseillaise_, and he will free theworld.This note jotted down on the margin of Anglès’ report, we will returnto our four couples.', 'The dinner, as we have said, was drawing to itsclose.CHAPTER VI—A CHAPTER IN WHICH THEY ADORE EACH OTHERChat at table, the chat of love; it is as impossible to reproduce oneas the other; the chat of love is a cloud; the chat at table is smoke.Fameuil and Dahlia were humming.', 'Tholomyès was drinking.', 'Zéphine waslaughing, Fantine smiling, Listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which hehad purchased at Saint-Cloud.Favourite gazed tenderly at Blachevelle and said:—“Blachevelle, I adore you.”This called forth a question from Blachevelle:—“What would you do, Favourite, if I were to cease to love you?”“I!” cried Favourite.', '“Ah!', 'Do not say that even in jest!', 'If you were tocease to love me, I would spring after you, I would scratch you, Ishould rend you, I would throw you into the water, I would have youarrested.”Blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man who istickled in his self-love.', 'Favourite resumed:—“Yes, I would scream to the police!', 'Ah!', 'I should not restrain myself,not at all!', 'Rabble!”Blachevelle threw himself back in his chair, in an ecstasy, and closedboth eyes proudly.Dahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid the uproar:—“So you really idolize him deeply, that Blachevelle of yours?”“I?', 'I detest him,” replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her forkagain.', '“He is avaricious.', 'I love the little fellow opposite me in myhouse.', 'He is very nice, that young man; do you know him?', 'One can seethat he is an actor by profession.', 'I love actors.', 'As soon as he comesin, his mother says to him: ‘Ah!', 'mon Dieu!', 'my peace of mind is gone.There he goes with his shouting.', 'But, my dear, you are splitting myhead!’ So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high ashe can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I knowwhat?', 'so that he can be heard downstairs!', 'He earns twenty sous a day atan attorney’s by penning quibbles.', 'He is the son of a former precentorof Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.', 'Ah!', 'he is very nice.', 'He idolizes me so,that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes, he said tome: _‘Mamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.’_It is only artists who can say such things as that.', 'Ah!', 'he is verynice.', 'I am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow.Never mind; I tell Blachevelle that I adore him—how I lie!', 'Hey!', 'How Ido lie!”Favourite paused, and then went on:—“I am sad, you see, Dahlia.', 'It has done nothing but rain all summer;the wind irritates me; the wind does not abate.', 'Blachevelle is verystingy; there are hardly any green peas in the market; one does notknow what to eat.', 'I have the spleen, as the English say, butter is sodear!', 'and then you see it is horrible, here we are dining in a roomwith a bed in it, and that disgusts me with life.”CHAPTER VII—THE WISDOM OF THOLOMYÈSIn the meantime, while some sang, the rest talked together tumultuouslyall at once; it was no longer anything but noise.', 'Tholomyès intervened.“Let us not talk at random nor too fast,” he exclaimed.', '“Let usreflect, if we wish to be brilliant.', 'Too much improvisation empties themind in a stupid way.', 'Running beer gathers no froth.', 'No haste,gentlemen.', 'Let us mingle majesty with the feast.', 'Let us eat withmeditation; let us make haste slowly.', 'Let us not hurry.', 'Consider thespringtime; if it makes haste, it is done for; that is to say, it getsfrozen.', 'Excess of zeal ruins peach-trees and apricot-trees.', 'Excess ofzeal kills the grace and the mirth of good dinners.', 'No zeal, gentlemen!Grimod de la Reynière agrees with Talleyrand.”A hollow sound of rebellion rumbled through the group.“Leave us in peace, Tholomyès,” said Blachevelle.“Down with the tyrant!” said Fameuil.“Bombarda, Bombance, and Bambochel!” cried Listolier.“Sunday exists,” resumed Fameuil.“We are sober,” added Listolier.“Tholomyès,” remarked Blachevelle, “contemplate my calmness [_moncalme_].”“You are the Marquis of that,” retorted Tholomyès.This mediocre play upon words produced the effect of a stone in a pool.The Marquis de Montcalm was at that time a celebrated royalist.', 'All thefrogs held their peace.“Friends,” cried Tholomyès, with the accent of a man who had recoveredhis empire, “Come to yourselves.', 'This pun which has fallen from theskies must not be received with too much stupor.', 'Everything which fallsin that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect.', 'Thepun is the dung of the mind which soars.', 'The jest falls, no matterwhere; and the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges intothe azure depths.', 'A whitish speck flattened against the rock does notprevent the condor from soaring aloft.', 'Far be it from me to insult thepun!', 'I honor it in proportion to its merits; nothing more.', 'All the mostaugust, the most sublime, the most charming of humanity, and perhapsoutside of humanity, have made puns.', 'Jesus Christ made a pun on St.Peter, Moses on Isaac, Æschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius.And observe that Cleopatra’s pun preceded the battle of Actium, andthat had it not been for it, no one would have remembered the city ofToryne, a Greek name which signifies a ladle.', 'That once conceded, Ireturn to my exhortation.', 'I repeat, brothers, I repeat, no zeal, nohubbub, no excess; even in witticisms, gayety, jollities, or plays onwords.', 'Listen to me.', 'I have the prudence of Amphiaraüs and the baldnessof Cæsar.', 'There must be a limit, even to rebuses.', '_Est modus in rebus_.“There must be a limit, even to dinners.', 'You are fond of appleturnovers, ladies;

the enemy has it.”Tholomyès paused.“Take breath, Tholomyès,” said Blachevelle.At the same moment Blachevelle, supported by Listolier and Fameuil,struck up to a plaintive air, one of those studio songs composed of thefirst words which come to hand, rhymed richly and not at all, asdestitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of thewind, which have their birth in the vapor of pipes, and are dissipatedand take their flight with them.', 'This is the couplet by which the groupreplied to Tholomyès’ harangue:—“The father turkey-cocks so graveSome money to an agent gave,That master good Clermont-TonnerreMight be made pope on Saint Johns’ day fair.But this good Clermont could not beMade pope, because no priest was he;And then their agent, whose wrath burned,With all their money back returned.”This was not calculated to calm Tholomyès’ improvisation;

there aremirrors [_glaces_] on the walls.”“I prefer them [_glaces_, ices] on my plate,” said Favourite.Blachevelle persisted:—“Look at the knives.', 'The handles are of silver at Bombarda’s and ofbone at Édon’s.', 'Now, silver is more valuable than bone.”“Except for those who have a silver chin,” observed Tholomyès.He was looking at the dome of the Invalides, which was visible fromBombarda’s windows.A pause ensued.“Tholomyès,” exclaimed Fameuil, “Listolier and I were having adiscussion just now.”“A discussion is a good thing,” replied Tholomyès; “a quarrel isbetter.”“We were disputing about philosophy.”“Well?”“Which do you prefer, Descartes or Spinoza?”“Désaugiers,” said Tholomyès.This decree pronounced, he took a drink, and went on:—“I consent to live.', 'All is not at an end on earth since we can stilltalk nonsense.', 'For that I return thanks to the immortal gods.', 'We lie.One lies, but one laughs.', 'One affirms, but one doubts.', 'The unexpectedbursts forth from the syllogism.', 'That is fine.', 'There are still humanbeings here below who know how to open and close the surprise box ofthe paradox merrily.', 'This, ladies, which you are drinking with sotranquil an air is Madeira wine, you must know, from the vineyard ofCoural das Freiras, which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms abovethe level of the sea.', 'Attention while you drink!', 'three hundred andseventeen fathoms!', 'and Monsieur Bombarda, the magnificent eating-housekeeper, gives you those three hundred and seventeen fathoms for fourfrancs and fifty centimes.”Again Fameuil interrupted him:—“Tholomyès, your opinions fix the law.', 'Who is your favorite author?”“Ber—”“Quin?”“No; Choux.”And Tholomyès continued:—“Honor to Bombarda!', 'He would equal Munophis of Elephanta if he couldbut get me an Indian dancing-girl, and Thygelion of Chæronea if hecould bring me a Greek courtesan; for, oh, ladies!', 'there were Bombardasin Greece and in Egypt.', 'Apuleius tells us of them.', 'Alas!', 'always thesame, and nothing new; nothing more unpublished by the creator increation!', '_Nil sub sole novum_, says Solomon; _amor omnibus idem_, saysVirgil; and Carabine mounts with Carabin into the bark at Saint-Cloud,as Aspasia embarked with Pericles upon the fleet at Samos.', 'One lastword.', 'Do you know what Aspasia was, ladies?', 'Although she lived at anepoch when women had, as yet, no soul, she was a soul; a soul of a rosyand purple hue, more ardent hued than fire, fresher than the dawn.Aspasia was a creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met; she wasthe goddess prostitute; Socrates plus Manon Lescaut.', 'Aspasia wascreated in case a mistress should be needed for Prometheus.”Tholomyès, once started, would have found some difficulty in stopping,had not a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that moment.', 'Theshock caused the cart and the orator to come to a dead halt.', 'It was aBeauceron mare, old and thin, and one fit for the knacker, which wasdragging a very heavy cart.', 'On arriving in front of Bombarda’s, theworn-out, exhausted beast had refused to proceed any further.', 'Thisincident attracted a crowd.', 'Hardly had the cursing and indignant carterhad time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word, _Mâtin_ (thejade), backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip, when the jade fell,never to rise again.', 'On hearing the hubbub made by the passers-by,Tholomyès’ merry auditors turned their heads, and Tholomyès tookadvantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close withthis melancholy strophe:—“Elle était de ce monde ou coucous et carrossesOnt le même destin;Et, rosse, elle a vécu ce que vivant les rosses,L’espace d’un mâtin!” 3“Poor horse!” sighed Fantine.And Dahlia exclaimed:—“There is Fantine on the point of crying over horses.', 'How can one besuch a pitiful fool as that!”At that moment Favourite, folding her arms and throwing her head back,looked resolutely at Tholomyès and said:—“Come, now!', 'the surprise?”“Exactly.', 'The moment has arrived,” replied Tholomyès.', '“Gentlemen, thehour for giving these ladies a surprise has struck.', 'Wait for us amoment, ladies.”“It begins with a kiss,” said Blachevelle.“On the brow,” added Tholomyès.Each gravely bestowed a kiss on his mistress’s brow; then all fourfiled out through the door, with their fingers on their lips.Favourite clapped her hands on their departure.“It is beginning to be amusing already,” said she.“Don’t be too long,” murmured Fantine; “we are waiting for you.”CHAPTER IX—A MERRY END TO MIRTHWhen the young girls were left alone, they leaned two by two on thewindow-sills, chatting, craning out their heads, and talking from onewindow to the other.They saw the young men emerge from the Café Bombarda arm in arm.', 'Thelatter turned round, made signs to them, smiled, and disappeared inthat dusty Sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into theChamps-Élysées.“Don’t be long!” cried Fantine.“What are they going to bring us?” said Zéphine.“It will certainly be something pretty,” said Dahlia.“For my part,” said Favourite, “I want it to be of gold.”Their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore ofthe lake, which they could see through the branches of the large trees,and which diverted them greatly.It was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences.Nearly all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through theChamps-Élysées.', 'The majority followed the quay and went through thePassy Barrier.', 'From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, painted yellowand black, heavily loaded, noisily harnessed, rendered shapeless bytrunks, tarpaulins, and valises, full of heads which immediatelydisappeared, rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge,with dust for smoke, and an air of fury, grinding the pavements,changing all the paving-stones into steels.', 'This uproar delighted theyoung girls.', 'Favourite exclaimed:—“What a row!', 'One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away.”It chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see withdifficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, then set outagain at a gallop.', 'This surprised Fantine.“That’s odd!” said she.', '“I thought the diligence never stopped.”Favourite shrugged her shoulders.“This Fantine is surprising.', 'I am coming to take a look at her out ofcuriosity.', 'She is dazzled by the simplest things.', 'Suppose a case: I ama traveller; I say to the diligence, ‘I will go on in advance; youshall pick me up on the quay as you pass.’ The diligence passes, seesme, halts, and takes me.', 'That is done every day.', 'You do not know life,my dear.”In this manner a certain time elapsed.', 'All at once Favourite made amovement, like a person who is just waking up.“Well,” said she, “and the surprise?”“Yes, by the way,” joined in Dahlia, “the famous surprise?”“They are a very long time about it!” said Fantine.As Fantine concluded this sigh, the waiter who had served them atdinner entered.', 'He held in his hand something which resembled a letter.“What is that?” demanded Favourite.The waiter replied:—“It is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies.”“Why did you not bring it at once?”“Because,” said the waiter, “the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver itto the ladies for an hour.”Favourite snatched the paper from the waiter’s hand.', 'It was, in fact, aletter.“Stop!” said she; “there is no address; but this is what is written onit—”“THIS IS THE SURPRISE.”She tore the letter open hastily, opened it, and read [she knew how toread]:—“OUR BELOVED:—“You must know that we have parents.', 'Parents—you do not know much aboutsuch things.', 'They are called fathers and mothers by the civil code,which is puerile and honest.', 'Now, these parents groan, these old folksimplore us, these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons;they desire our return, and offer to kill calves for us.', 'Beingvirtuous, we obey them.', 'At the hour when you read this, five fieryhorses will be bearing us to our papas and mammas.', 'We are pulling upour stakes, as Bossuet says.', 'We are going; we are gone.', 'We flee in thearms of Laffitte and on the wings of Caillard.', 'The Toulouse diligencetears us from the abyss, and the abyss is you, O our little beauties!We return to society, to duty, to respectability, at full trot, at therate of three leagues an hour.', 'It is necessary for the good of thecountry that we should be, like the rest of the world, prefects,fathers of families, rural police, and councillors of state.', 'Venerateus.', 'We are sacrificing ourselves.', 'Mourn for us in haste, and replace uswith speed.', 'If this letter lacerates you, do the same by it.', 'Adieu.“For the space of nearly two years we have made you happy.', 'We bear youno grudge for that.', '“Signed:BLACHEVELLE.FAMUEIL.LISTOLIER.FÉLIX THOLOMYÈS.“_Postscriptum_.', 'The dinner is paid for.”The four young women looked at each other.Favourite was the first to break the silence.“Well!” she exclaimed, “it’s a very pretty farce, all the same.”“It is very droll,” said Zéphine.“That must have been Blachevelle’s idea,” resumed Favourite.', '“It makesme in love with him.', 'No sooner is he gone than he is loved.', 'This is anadventure, indeed.”“No,” said Dahlia; “it was one of Tholomyès’ ideas.', 'That is evident.“In that case,” retorted Favourite, “death to Blachevelle, and longlive Tholomyès!”“Long live Tholomyès!” exclaimed Dahlia and Zéphine.And they burst out laughing.Fantine laughed with the rest.An hour later, when she had returned to her room, she wept.', 'It was herfirst love affair, as we have said; she had given herself to thisTholomyès as to a husband, and the poor girl had a child.BOOK FOURTH—TO CONFIDE IS SOMETIMES TO DELIVER INTO A PERSON’S POWERCHAPTER I—ONE MOTHER MEETS ANOTHER MOTHERThere was, at Montfermeil, near Paris, during the first quarter of thiscentury, a sort of cook-shop which no longer exists.', 'This cook-shop waskept by some people named Thénardier, husband and wife.', 'It was situatedin Boulanger Lane.', 'Over the door there was a board nailed flat againstthe wall.', 'Upon this board was painted something which resembled a mancarrying another man on his back, the latter wearing the big giltepaulettes of a general, with large silver stars; red spots representedblood; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke, and probablyrepresented a battle.', 'Below ran this inscription: AT THE SIGN OFSERGEANT OF WATERLOO (_Au Sargent de Waterloo_).Nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of ahostelry.', 'Nevertheless, the vehicle, or, to speak more accurately, thefragment of a vehicle, which encumbered the street in front of thecook-shop of the _Sergeant of Waterloo_, one evening in the spring of1818, would certainly have attracted, by its mass, the attention of anypainter who had passed that way.It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used inwooded tracts of country, and which serve to transport thick planks andthe trunks of trees.', 'This fore-carriage was composed of a massive ironaxle-tree with a pivot, into which was fitted a heavy shaft, and whichwas supported by two huge wheels.', 'The whole thing was compact,overwhelming, and misshapen.', 'It seemed like the gun-carriage of anenormous cannon.', 'The ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels, thefellies, the hub, the axle, and the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideousyellowish daubing hue, tolerably like that with which people are fondof ornamenting cathedrals.', 'The wood was disappearing under mud, and theiron beneath rust.', 'Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a hugechain, worthy of some Goliath of a convict.', 'This chain suggested, notthe beams, which it was its office to transport, but the mastodons andmammoths which it might have served to harness; it had the air of thegalleys, but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys, and it seemed to havebeen detached from some monster.', 'Homer would have bound Polyphemus withit, and Shakespeare, Caliban.Why was that fore-carriage of a truck in that place in the street?', 'Inthe first place, to encumber the street; next, in order that it mightfinish the process of rusting.', 'There is a throng of institutions in theold social order, which one comes across in this fashion as one walksabout outdoors, and which have no other reasons for existence than theabove.The centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle, andin the loop, as in the rope of a swing, there were seated and grouped,on that particular evening, in exquisite interlacement, two littlegirls; one about two years and a half old, the other, eighteen months;the younger in the arms of the other.', 'A handkerchief, cleverly knottedabout them, prevented their falling out.', 'A mother had caught sight ofthat frightful chain, and had said, “Come!', 'there’s a plaything for mychildren.”The two children, who were dressed prettily and with some elegance,were radiant with pleasure; one would have said that they were tworoses amid old iron; their eyes were a triumph; their fresh cheeks werefull of laughter.', 'One had chestnut hair; the other, brown.', 'Theirinnocent faces were two delighted surprises; a blossoming shrub whichgrew near wafted to the passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanatefrom them; the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty littlebare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood.', 'Above and aroundthese two delicate heads, all made of happiness and steeped in light,the gigantic fore-carriage, black with rust, almost terrible, allentangled in curves and wild angles, rose in a vault, like the entranceof a cavern.', 'A few paces apart, crouching down upon the threshold ofthe hostelry, the mother, not a very prepossessing woman, by the way,though touching at that moment, was swinging the two children by meansof a long cord, watching them carefully, for fear of accidents, withthat animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity.', 'Atevery backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a stridentsound, which resembled a cry of rage; the little girls were inecstasies; the setting sun mingled in this joy, and nothing could bemore charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain ofTitans the swing of cherubim.As she rocked her little ones, the mother hummed in a discordant voicea romance then celebrated:—“It must be, said a warrior.”Her song, and the contemplation of her daughters, prevented her hearingand seeing what was going on in the street.In the meantime, some one had approached her, as she was beginning thefirst couplet of the romance, and suddenly she heard a voice sayingvery near her ear:—“You have two beautiful children there, Madame.”“To the fair and tender Imogene—”replied the mother, continuing her romance; then she turned her head.A woman stood before her, a few paces distant.', 'This woman also had achild, which she carried in her arms.She was carrying, in addition, a large carpet-bag, which seemed veryheavy.This woman’s child was one of the most divine creatures that it ispossible to behold.', 'It was a girl, two or three years of age.', 'She couldhave entered into competition with the two other little ones, so far asthe coquetry of her dress was concerned; she wore a cap of fine linen,ribbons on her bodice, and Valenciennes lace on her cap.', 'The folds ofher skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white, firm, anddimpled leg.', 'She was admirably rosy and healthy.', 'The little beautyinspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks.', 'Of hereyes nothing could be known, except that they must be very large, andthat they had magnificent lashes.', 'She was asleep.She slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age.The arms of mothers are made of tenderness; in them children sleepprofoundly.As for the mother, her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken.', 'She wasdressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into a peasantagain.', 'She was young.', 'Was she handsome?', 'Perhaps; but in that attire itwas not apparent.', 'Her hair, a golden lock of which had escaped, seemedvery thick, but was severely concealed beneath an ugly, tight, close,nun-like cap, tied under the chin.', 'A smile displays beautiful teethwhen one has them; but she did not smile.', 'Her eyes did not seem to havebeen dry for a very long time.', 'She was pale; she had a very weary andrather sickly appearance.', 'She gazed upon her daughter asleep in herarms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child.', 'Alarge blue handkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was folded into afichu, and concealed her figure clumsily.', 'Her hands were sunburnt andall dotted with freckles, her forefinger was hardened and laceratedwith the needle; she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, alinen gown, and coarse shoes.', 'It was Fantine.It was Fantine, but difficult to recognize.', 'Nevertheless, onscrutinizing her attentively, it was evident that she still retainedher beauty.', 'A melancholy fold, which resembled the beginning of irony,wrinkled her right cheek.', 'As for her toilette, that aerial toilette ofmuslin and ribbons, which seemed made of mirth, of folly, and of music,full of bells, and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like thatbeautiful and dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for diamonds in thesunlight; it melts and leaves the branch quite black.Ten months had elapsed since the “pretty farce.”What had taken place during those ten months?', 'It can be divined.After abandonment, straightened circumstances.', 'Fantine had immediatelylost sight of Favourite, Zéphine and Dahlia; the bond once broken onthe side of the men, it was loosed between the women; they would havebeen greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later, thatthey had been friends; there no longer existed any reason for such athing.', 'Fantine had remained alone.', 'The father of her child gone,—alas!such ruptures are irrevocable,—she found herself absolutely isolated,minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure.', 'Drawn away byher _liaison_ with Tholomyès to disdain the pretty trade which sheknew, she had neglected to keep her market open; it was now closed toher.', 'She had no resource.', 'Fantine barely knew how to read, and did notknow how to write; in her childhood she had only been taught to signher name; she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle toTholomyès, then a second, then a third.', 'Tholomyès replied to none ofthem.', 'Fantine heard the gossips say, as they looked at her child: “Whotakes those children seriously!', 'One only shrugs one’s shoulders oversuch children!” Then she thought of Tholomyès, who had shrugged hisshoulders over his child, and who did not take that innocent beingseriously; and her heart grew gloomy toward that man.', 'But what was sheto do?', 'She no longer knew to whom to apply.', 'She had committed a fault,but the foundation of her nature, as will be remembered, was modestyand virtue.', 'She was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge offalling into distress, and of gliding into a worse state.', 'Courage wasnecessary; she possessed it, and held herself firm.', 'The idea ofreturning to her native town of M. sur M. occurred to her.', 'There, someone might possibly know her and give her work; yes, but it would benecessary to conceal her fault.', 'In a confused way she perceived thenecessity of a separation which would be more painful than the firstone.', 'Her heart contracted, but she took her resolution.', 'Fantine, as weshall see, had the fierce bravery of life.', 'She had already valiantlyrenounced finery, had dressed herself in linen, and had put all hersilks, all her ornaments, all her ribbons, and all her laces on herdaughter, the only vanity which was left to her, and a holy one it was.She sold all that she had, which produced for her two hundred francs;her little debts paid, she had only about eighty francs left.', 'At theage of twenty-two, on a beautiful spring morning, she quitted Paris,bearing her child on her back.', 'Any one who had seen these two passwould have had pity on them.', 'This woman had, in all the world, nothingbut her child, and the child had, in all the world, no one but thiswoman.', 'Fantine had nursed her child, and this had tired her chest, andshe coughed a little.We shall have no further occasion to speak of M. Félix Tholomyès.', 'Letus confine ourselves to saying, that, twenty years later, under KingLouis Philippe, he was a great provincial lawyer, wealthy andinfluential, a wise elector, and a very severe juryman; he was still aman of pleasure.Towards the middle of the day, after having, from time to time, for thesake of resting herself, travelled, for three or four sous a league, inwhat was then known as the _Petites Voitures des Environs de Paris_,the “little suburban coach service,” Fantine found herself atMontfermeil, in the alley Boulanger.As she passed the Thénardier hostelry, the two little girls, blissfulin the monster swing, had dazzled her in a manner, and she had haltedin front of that vision of joy.Charms exist.', 'These two little girls were a charm to this mother.She gazed at them in much emotion.', 'The presence of angels is anannouncement of Paradise.', 'She thought that, above this inn, she beheldthe mysterious HERE of Providence.', 'These two little creatures wereevidently happy.', 'She gazed at them, she admired them, in such emotionthat at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath betweentwo couplets of her song, she could not refrain from addressing to herthe remark which we have just read:—“You have two pretty children, Madame.”The most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on theiryoung.The mother raised her head and thanked her, and bade the wayfarer sitdown on the bench at the door, she herself being seated on thethreshold.', 'The two women began to chat.“My name is Madame Thénardier,” said the mother of the two littlegirls.', '“We keep this inn.”Then, her mind still running on her romance, she resumed hummingbetween her teeth:—“It must be so; I am a knight,And I am off to Palestine.”This Madame Thénardier was a sandy-complexioned woman, thin andangular—the type of the soldier’s wife in all its unpleasantness; andwhat was odd, with a languishing air, which she owed to her perusal ofromances.', 'She was a simpering, but masculine creature.', 'Old romancesproduce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook-shopwoman.', 'She was still young; she was barely thirty.', 'If this crouchingwoman had stood upright, her lofty stature and her frame of aperambulating colossus suitable for fairs, might have frightened thetraveller at the outset, troubled her confidence, and disturbed whatcaused what we have to relate to vanish.', 'A person who is seated insteadof standing erect—destinies hang upon such a thing as that.The traveller told her story, with slight modifications.That she was a working-woman; that her husband was dead; that her workin Paris had failed her, and that she was on her way to seek itelsewhere, in her own native parts; that she had left Paris thatmorning on foot; that, as she was carrying her child, and feltfatigued, she had got into the Villemomble coach when she met it; thatfrom Villemomble she had come to Montfermeil on foot; that the littleone had walked a little, but not much, because she was so young, andthat she had been obliged to take her up, and the jewel had fallenasleep.At this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss, which wokeher.', 'The child opened her eyes, great blue eyes like her mother’s, andlooked at—what?', 'Nothing; with that serious and sometimes severe air oflittle children, which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in thepresence of our twilight of virtue.', 'One would say that they feelthemselves to be angels, and that they know us to be men.', 'Then thechild began to laugh; and although the mother held fast to her, sheslipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little beingwhich wished to run.', 'All at once she caught sight of the two others inthe swing, stopped short, and put out her tongue, in sign ofadmiration.Mother Thénardier released her daughters, made them descend from theswing, and said:—“Now amuse yourselves, all three of you.”Children become acquainted quickly at that age, and at the expirationof a minute the little Thénardiers were playing with the newcomer atmaking holes in the ground, which was an immense pleasure.The newcomer was very gay; the goodness of the mother is written in thegayety of the child; she had seized a scrap of wood which served herfor a shovel, and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly.', 'Thegrave-digger’s business becomes a subject for laughter when performedby a child.The two women pursued their chat.“What is your little one’s name?”“Cosette.”For Cosette, read Euphrasie.', 'The child’s name was Euphrasie.', 'But out ofEuphrasie the mother had made Cosette by that sweet and gracefulinstinct of mothers and of the populace which changes Josepha intoPepita, and Françoise into Sillette.', 'It is a sort of derivative whichdisarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists.', 'We haveknown a grandmother who succeeded in turning Theodore into Gnon.“How old is she?”“She is going on three.”“That is the age of my eldest.”In the meantime, the three little girls were grouped in an attitude ofprofound anxiety and blissfulness; an event had happened; a big wormhad emerged from the ground, and they were afraid; and they were inecstasies over it.Their radiant brows touched each other; one would have said that therewere three heads in one aureole.“How easily children get acquainted at once!” exclaimed MotherThénardier; “one would swear that they were three sisters!”This remark was probably the spark which the other mother had beenwaiting for.', 'She seized the Thénardier’s hand, looked at her fixedly,and said:—“Will you keep my child for me?”The Thénardier made one of those movements of surprise which signifyneither assent nor refusal.Cosette’s mother continued:—“You see, I cannot take my daughter to the country.', 'My work will notpermit it.', 'With a child one can find no situation.', 'People areridiculous in the country.', 'It was the good God who caused me to passyour inn.', 'When I caught sight of your little ones, so pretty, so clean,and so happy, it overwhelmed me.', 'I said: ‘Here is a good mother.', 'Thatis just the thing; that will make three sisters.’ And then, it will notbe long before I return.', 'Will you keep my child for me?”“I must see about it,” replied the Thénardier.“I will give you six francs a month.”Here a man’s voice called from the depths of the cook-shop:—“Not for less than seven francs.', 'And six months paid in advance.”“Six times seven makes forty-two,” said the Thénardier.“I will give it,” said the mother.“And fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses,” added theman’s voice.“Total, fifty-seven francs,” said Madame Thénardier.', 'And she hummedvaguely, with these figures:—“It must be, said a warrior.”“I will pay it,” said the mother.', '“I have eighty francs.', 'I shall haveenough left to reach the country, by travelling on foot.', 'I shall earnmoney there, and as soon as I have a little I will return for mydarling.”The man’s voice resumed:—“The little one has an outfit?”“That is my husband,” said the Thénardier.“Of course she has an outfit, the poor treasure.—I understood perfectlythat it was your husband.—And a beautiful outfit, too!', 'a senselessoutfit, everything by the dozen, and silk gowns like a lady.', 'It ishere, in my carpet-bag.”“You must hand it over,” struck in the man’s voice again.“Of course I shall give it to you,” said the mother.', '“It would be veryqueer if I were to leave my daughter quite naked!”The master’s face appeared.“That’s good,” said he.The bargain was concluded.', 'The mother passed the night at the inn, gaveup her money and left her child, fastened her carpet-bag once more, nowreduced in volume by the removal of the outfit, and light henceforthand set out on the following morning, intending to return soon.', 'Peoplearrange such departures tranquilly; but they are despairs!A neighbor of the Thénardiers met this mother as she was setting out,and came back with the remark:—“I have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough torend your heart.”When Cosette’s mother had taken her departure, the man said to thewoman:—“That will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs whichfalls due to-morrow; I lacked fifty francs.', 'Do you know that I shouldhave had a bailiff and a protest after me?', 'You played the mouse-trapnicely with your young ones.”“Without suspecting it,” said the woman.CHAPTER II—FIRST SKETCH OF TWO UNPREPOSSESSING FIGURESThe mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen; but the catrejoices even over a lean mouse.Who were these Thénardiers?Let us say a word or two of them now.', 'We will complete the sketch lateron.These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse peoplewho have been successful, and of intelligent people who have descendedin the scale, which is between the class called “middle” and the classdenominated as “inferior,” and which combines some of the defects ofthe second with nearly all the vices of the first, without possessingthe generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of thebourgeois.They were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances towarm them up, easily become monstrous.', 'There was in the woman asubstratum of the brute, and in the man the material for a blackguard.Both were susceptible, in the highest degree, of the sort of hideousprogress which is accomplished in the direction of evil.', 'There existcrab-like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness,retrograding in life rather than advancing, employing experience toaugment their deformity, growing incessantly worse, and becoming moreand more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness.', 'This man andwoman possessed such souls.Thénardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist.', 'One canonly look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they aredark in both directions.', 'They are uneasy in the rear and threatening infront.', 'There is something of the unknown about them.', 'One can no moreanswer for what they have done than for what they will do.', 'The shadowwhich they bear in their glance denounces them.', 'From merely hearingthem utter a word or seeing them make a gesture, one obtains a glimpseof sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in theirfuture.This Thénardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been a soldier—asergeant, he said.', 'He had probably been through the campaign of 1815,and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem.', 'Weshall see later on how much truth there was in this.', 'The sign of hishostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms.', 'He had painted ithimself; for he knew how to do a little of everything, and badly.It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, afterhaving been _Clélie_, was no longer anything but _Lodoïska_, stillnoble, but ever more and more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoisellede Scudéri to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette toMadame Barthélemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of theportresses of Paris aflame, and even ravaging the suburbs to someextent.', 'Madame Thénardier was just intelligent enough to read this sortof books.', 'She lived on them.', 'In them she drowned what brains shepossessed.', 'This had given her, when very young, and even a littlelater, a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband, a scamp of acertain depth, a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar, coarseand fine at one and the same time, but, so far as sentimentalism wasconcerned, given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and “in whatconcerns the sex,” as he said in his jargon—a downright, unmitigatedlout.', 'His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was.', 'Lateron, when her hair, arranged in a romantically drooping fashion, beganto grow gray, when the Megæra began to be developed from the Pamela,the female Thénardier was nothing but a coarse, vicious woman, who haddabbled in stupid romances.', 'Now, one cannot read nonsense withimpunity.', 'The result was that her eldest daughter was named Éponine; asfor the younger, the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare;I know not to what diversion, effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil,she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma.However, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous andsuperficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, and whichmay be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names.', 'By the side ofthis romantic element which we have just indicated there is the socialsymptom.', 'It is not rare for the neatherd’s boy nowadays to bear thename of Arthur, Alfred, or Alphonse, and for the vicomte—if there arestill any vicomtes—to be called Thomas, Pierre, or Jacques.', 'Thisdisplacement, which places the “elegant” name on the plebeian and therustic name on the aristocrat, is nothing else than an eddy ofequality.', 'The irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is thereas everywhere else.', 'Beneath this apparent discord there is a great anda profound thing,—the French Revolution.CHAPTER III—THE LARKIt is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper.', 'Thecook-shop was in a bad way.Thanks to the traveller’s fifty-seven francs, Thénardier had been ableto avoid a protest and to honor his signature.', 'On the following monththey were again in need of money.', 'The woman took Cosette’s outfit toParis, and pawned it at the pawnbroker’s for sixty francs.', 'As soon asthat sum was spent, the Thénardiers grew accustomed to look on thelittle girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity;and they treated her accordingly.', 'As she had no longer any clothes,they dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of theThénardier brats; that is to say, in rags.', 'They fed her on what all therest had left—a little better than the dog, a little worse than thecat.', 'Moreover, the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions;Cosette ate with them under the table, from a wooden bowl similar totheirs.The mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, atM.', 'sur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, a letterevery month, that she might have news of her child.', 'The Thénardiersreplied invariably, “Cosette is doing wonderfully well.”At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francsfor the seventh month, and continued her remittances with tolerableregularity from month to month.', 'The year was not completed whenThénardier said: “A fine favor she is doing us, in sooth!', 'What does sheexpect us to do with her seven francs?” and he wrote to demand twelvefrancs.', 'The mother, whom they had persuaded into the belief that herchild was happy, “and was coming on well,” submitted, and forwarded thetwelve francs.Certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on theother.', 'Mother Thénardier loved her two daughters passionately, whichcaused her to hate the stranger.It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainousaspects.', 'Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed to heras though it were taken from her own, and that that little childdiminished the air which her daughters breathed.', 'This woman, like manywomen of her sort, had a load of caresses and a burden of blows andinjuries to dispense each day.', 'If she had not had Cosette, it iscertain that her daughters, idolized as they were, would have receivedthe whole of it;

that is all.A year passed; then another.People in the village said:—“Those Thénardiers are good people.', 'They are not rich, and yet they arebringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands!”They thought that Cosette’s mother had forgotten her.In the meanwhile, Thénardier, having learned, it is impossible to sayby what obscure means, that the child was probably a bastard, and thatthe mother could not acknowledge it, exacted fifteen francs a month,saying that “the creature” was growing and “eating,” and threatening tosend her away.', '“Let her not bother me,” he exclaimed, “or I’ll fire herbrat right into the middle of her secrets.', 'I must have an increase.”The mother paid the fifteen francs.From year to year the child grew, and so did her wretchedness.As long as Cosette was little, she was the scape-goat of the two otherchildren;

we should almost say, to underline it.From time immemorial, M. sur M. had had for its special industry theimitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany.', 'Thisindustry had always vegetated, on account of the high price of the rawmaterial, which reacted on the manufacture.', 'At the moment when Fantinereturned to M. sur M., an unheard-of transformation had taken place inthe production of “black goods.” Towards the close of 1815 a man, astranger, had established himself in the town, and had been inspiredwith the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, gum-lac for resin,and, for bracelets in particular, slides of sheet-iron simply laidtogether, for slides of soldered sheet-iron.This very small change had effected a revolution.This very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost ofthe raw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, toraise the price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; in the secondplace, to improve the workmanship, an advantage to the consumer; in thethird place, to sell at a lower price, while trebling the profit, whichwas a benefit to the manufacturer.Thus three results ensued from one idea.In less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich,which is good, and had made every one about him rich, which is better.He was a stranger in the Department.', 'Of his origin, nothing was known;of the beginning of his career, very little.', 'It was rumored that he hadcome to town with very little money, a few hundred francs at the most.It was from this slender capital, enlisted in the service of aningenious idea, developed by method and thought, that he had drawn hisown fortune, and the fortune of the whole countryside.On his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments, the appearance,and the language of a workingman.It appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into thelittle town of M. sur M., just at nightfall, on a December evening,knapsack on back and thorn club in hand, a large fire had broken out inthe town-hall.', 'This man had rushed into the flames and saved, at therisk of his own life, two children who belonged to the captain of thegendarmerie; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for hispassport.', 'Afterwards they had learned his name.', 'He was called FatherMadeleine.CHAPTER II—MADELEINEHe was a man about fifty years of age, who had a preoccupied air, andwho was good.', 'That was all that could be said about him.Thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirablyreconstructed, M. sur M. had become a rather important centre of trade.Spain, which consumes a good deal of black jet, made enormous purchasesthere each year.', 'M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in thisbranch of commerce.', 'Father Madeleine’s profits were such, that at theend of the second year he was able to erect a large factory, in whichthere were two vast workrooms, one for the men, and the other forwomen.', 'Any one who was hungry could present himself there, and was sureof finding employment and bread.', 'Father Madeleine required of the mengood will, of the women pure morals, and of all, probity.', 'He hadseparated the work-rooms in order to separate the sexes, and so thatthe women and girls might remain discreet.', 'On this point he wasinflexible.', 'It was the only thing in which he was in a mannerintolerant.', 'He was all the more firmly set on this severity, since M.sur M., being a garrison town, opportunities for corruption abounded.However, his coming had been a boon, and his presence was a godsend.Before Father Madeleine’s arrival, everything had languished in thecountry; now everything lived with a healthy life of toil.', 'A strongcirculation warmed everything and penetrated everywhere.', 'Slack seasonsand wretchedness were unknown.', 'There was no pocket so obscure that ithad not a little money in it; no dwelling so lowly that there was notsome little joy within it.Father Madeleine gave employment to every one.', 'He exacted but onething: Be an honest man.', 'Be an honest woman.As we have said, in the midst of this activity of which he was thecause and the pivot, Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singularthing in a simple man of business, it did not seem as though that werehis chief care.', 'He appeared to be thinking much of others, and littleof himself.', 'In 1820 he was known to have a sum of six hundred andthirty thousand francs lodged in his name with Laffitte; but beforereserving these six hundred and thirty thousand francs, he had spentmore than a million for the town and its poor.The hospital was badly endowed; he founded six beds there.', 'M. sur M. isdivided into the upper and the lower town.', 'The lower town, in which helived, had but one school, a miserable hovel, which was falling toruin: he constructed two, one for girls, the other for boys.', 'Heallotted a salary from his own funds to the two instructors, a salarytwice as large as their meagre official salary, and one day he said tosome one who expressed surprise, “The two prime functionaries of thestate are the nurse and the schoolmaster.” He created at his ownexpense an infant school, a thing then almost unknown in France, and afund for aiding old and infirm workmen.', 'As his factory was a centre, anew quarter, in which there were a good many indigent families, roserapidly around him; he established there a free dispensary.At first, when they watched his beginnings, the good souls said, “He’sa jolly fellow who means to get rich.” When they saw him enriching thecountry before he enriched himself, the good souls said, “He is anambitious man.” This seemed all the more probable since the man wasreligious, and even practised his religion to a certain degree, a thingwhich was very favorably viewed at that epoch.', 'He went regularly to lowmass every Sunday.', 'The local deputy, who nosed out all rivalryeverywhere, soon began to grow uneasy over this religion.', 'This deputyhad been a member of the legislative body of the Empire, and shared thereligious ideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the name ofFouché, Duc d’Otrante, whose creature and friend he had been.', 'Heindulged in gentle raillery at God with closed doors.', 'But when hebeheld the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seveno’clock, he perceived in him a possible candidate, and resolved tooutdo him; he took a Jesuit confessor, and went to high mass and tovespers.', 'Ambition was at that time, in the direct acceptation of theword, a race to the steeple.', 'The poor profited by this terror as wellas the good God, for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in thehospital, which made twelve.Nevertheless, in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the townto the effect that, on the representations of the prefect and inconsideration of the services rendered by him to the country, FatherMadeleine was to be appointed by the King, mayor of M. sur M. Those whohad pronounced this newcomer to be “an ambitious fellow,” seized withdelight on this opportunity which all men desire, to exclaim, “There!what did we say!” All M. sur M. was in an uproar.', 'The rumor was wellfounded.', 'Several days later the appointment appeared in the _Moniteur_.On the following day Father Madeleine refused.In this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented byMadeleine figured in the industrial exhibition; when the jury madetheir report, the King appointed the inventor a chevalier of the Legionof Honor.', 'A fresh excitement in the little town.', 'Well, so it was thecross that he wanted!', 'Father Madeleine refused the cross.Decidedly this man was an enigma.', 'The good souls got out of theirpredicament by saying, “After all, he is some sort of an adventurer.”We have seen that the country owed much to him; the poor owed himeverything; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had beenobliged to honor and respect him.', 'His workmen, in particular, adoredhim, and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity.When he was known to be rich, “people in society” bowed to him, and hereceived invitations in the town; he was called, in town, MonsieurMadeleine; his workmen and the children continued to call him FatherMadeleine, and that was what was most adapted to make him smile.', 'Inproportion as he mounted, throve, invitations rained down upon him.“Society” claimed him for its own.', 'The prim little drawing-rooms on M.sur M., which, of course, had at first been closed to the artisan,opened both leaves of their folding-doors to the millionnaire.', 'Theymade a thousand advances to him.', 'He refused.This time the good gossips had no trouble.', '“He is an ignorant man, ofno education.', 'No one knows where he came from.', 'He would not know how tobehave in society.', 'It has not been absolutely proved that he knows howto read.”When they saw him making money, they said, “He is a man of business.”When they saw him scattering his money about, they said, “He is anambitious man.” When he was seen to decline honors, they said, “He isan adventurer.” When they saw him repulse society, they said, “He is abrute.”In 1820, five years after his arrival in M. sur M., the services whichhe had rendered to the district were so dazzling, the opinion of thewhole country round about was so unanimous, that the King againappointed him mayor of the town.', 'He again declined; but the prefectresisted his refusal, all the notabilities of the place came to implorehim, the people in the street besought him; the urging was so vigorousthat he ended by accepting.', 'It was noticed that the thing which seemedchiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostropheaddressed to him by an old woman of the people, who called to him fromher threshold, in an angry way: _“A good mayor is a useful thing.', 'Is hedrawing back before the good which he can do?”_This was the third phase of his ascent.', 'Father Madeleine had becomeMonsieur Madeleine.', 'Monsieur Madeleine became Monsieur le Maire.CHAPTER III—SUMS DEPOSITED WITH LAFFITTEOn the other hand, he remained as simple as on the first day.', 'He hadgray hair, a serious eye, the sunburned complexion of a laborer, thethoughtful visage of a philosopher.', 'He habitually wore a hat with awide brim, and a long coat of coarse cloth, buttoned to the chin.', 'Hefulfilled his duties as mayor; but, with that exception, he lived insolitude.', 'He spoke to but few people.', 'He avoided polite attentions; heescaped quickly; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity oftalking; he gave, in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling.', 'Thewomen said of him, “What a good-natured bear!” His pleasure consistedin strolling in the fields.He always took his meals alone, with an open book before him, which heread.', 'He had a well-selected little library.', 'He loved books; books arecold but safe friends.', 'In proportion as leisure came to him withfortune, he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind.', 'Ithad been observed that, ever since his arrival at M. sur M., hislanguage had grown more polished, more choice, and more gentle withevery passing year.', 'He liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls,but he rarely made use of it.', 'When he did happen to do so, his shootingwas something so infallible as to inspire terror.', 'He never killed aninoffensive animal.', 'He never shot at a little bird.Although he was no longer young, it was thought that he was stillprodigiously strong.', 'He offered his assistance to any one who was inneed of it, lifted a horse, released a wheel clogged in the mud, orstopped a runaway bull by the horns.', 'He always had his pockets full ofmoney when he went out; but they were empty on his return.', 'When hepassed through a village, the ragged brats ran joyously after him, andsurrounded him like a swarm of gnats.It was thought that he must, in the past, have lived a country life,since he knew all sorts of useful secrets, which he taught to thepeasants.', 'He taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat, by sprinklingit and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with asolution of common salt; and how to chase away weevils by hanging uporviot in bloom everywhere, on the walls and the ceilings, among thegrass and in the houses.He had “recipes” for exterminating from a field, blight, tares,foxtail, and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat.', 'He defendeda rabbit warren against rats, simply by the odor of a guinea-pig whichhe placed in it.One day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling upnettles; he examined the plants, which were uprooted and already dried,and said: “They are dead.', 'Nevertheless, it would be a good thing toknow how to make use of them.', 'When the nettle is young, the leaf makesan excellent vegetable; when it is older, it has filaments and fibreslike hemp and flax.', 'Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth.', 'Chopped up,nettles are good for poultry; pounded, they are good for horned cattle.The seed of the nettle, mixed with fodder, gives gloss to the hair ofanimals; the root, mixed with salt, produces a beautiful yellowcoloring-matter.', 'Moreover, it is an excellent hay, which can be cuttwice.', 'And what is required for the nettle?', 'A little soil, no care, noculture.', 'Only the seed falls as it is ripe, and it is difficult tocollect it.', 'That is all.', 'With the exercise of a little care, the nettlecould be made useful; it is neglected and it becomes hurtful.', 'It isexterminated.', 'How many men resemble the nettle!” He added, after apause: “Remember this, my friends: there are no such things as badplants or bad men.', 'There are only bad cultivators.”The children loved him because he knew how to make charming littletrifles of straw and cocoanuts.When he saw the door of a church hung in black, he entered: he soughtout funerals as other men seek christenings.', 'Widowhood and the grief ofothers attracted him, because of his great gentleness; he mingled withthe friends clad in mourning, with families dressed in black, with thepriests groaning around a coffin.', 'He seemed to like to give to histhoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision ofthe other world.', 'With his eyes fixed on heaven, he listened with a sortof aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite, those sadvoices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death.He performed a multitude of good actions, concealing his agency in themas a man conceals himself because of evil actions.', 'He penetrated housesprivately, at night; he ascended staircases furtively.', 'A poor wretch onreturning to his attic would find that his door had been opened,sometimes even forced, during his absence.', 'The poor man made a clamorover it: some malefactor had been there!', 'He entered, and the firstthing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten on some piece offurniture.', 'The “malefactor” who had been there was Father Madeleine.He was affable and sad.', 'The people said: “There is a rich man who hasnot a haughty air.', 'There is a happy man who has not a contented air.”Some people maintained that he was a mysterious person, and that no oneever entered his chamber, which was a regular anchorite’s cell,furnished with winged hour-glasses and enlivened by cross-bones andskulls of dead men!', 'This was much talked of, so that one of the elegantand malicious young women of M. sur M. came to him one day, and asked:“Monsieur le Maire, pray show us your chamber.', 'It is said to be agrotto.” He smiled, and introduced them instantly into this “grotto.”They were well punished for their curiosity.', 'The room was very simplyfurnished in mahogany, which was rather ugly, like all furniture ofthat sort, and hung with paper worth twelve sous.', 'They could seenothing remarkable about it, except two candlesticks of antique patternwhich stood on the chimney-piece and appeared to be silver, “for theywere hall-marked,” an observation full of the type of wit of pettytowns.Nevertheless, people continued to say that no one ever got into theroom, and that it was a hermit’s cave, a mysterious retreat, a hole, atomb.It was also whispered about that he had “immense” sums deposited withLaffitte, with this peculiar feature, that they were always at hisimmediate disposal, so that, it was added, M. Madeleine could make hisappearance at Laffitte’s any morning, sign a receipt, and carry off histwo or three millions in ten minutes.', 'In reality, “these two or threemillions” were reducible, as we have said, to six hundred and thirty orforty thousand francs.CHAPTER IV—M.', 'MADELEINE IN MOURNINGAt the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death of M.Myriel, Bishop of D——, surnamed “Monseigneur Bienvenu,” who had died inthe odor of sanctity at the age of eighty-two.The Bishop of D—— to supply here a detail which the papers omitted—hadbeen blind for many years before his death, and content to be blind, ashis sister was beside him.Let us remark by the way, that to be blind and to be loved, is, infact, one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon thisearth, where nothing is complete.', 'To have continually at one’s side awoman, a daughter, a sister, a charming being, who is there because youneed her and because she cannot do without you; to know that we areindispensable to a person who is necessary to us; to be able toincessantly measure one’s affection by the amount of her presence whichshe bestows on us, and to say to ourselves, “Since she consecrates thewhole of her time to me, it is because I possess the whole of herheart”; to behold her thought in lieu of her face; to be able to verifythe fidelity of one being amid the eclipse of the world; to regard therustle of a gown as the sound of wings; to hear her come and go,retire, speak, return, sing, and to think that one is the centre ofthese steps, of this speech; to manifest at each instant one’s personalattraction; to feel one’s self all the more powerful because of one’sinfirmity; to become in one’s obscurity, and through one’s obscurity,the star around which this angel gravitates,—few felicities equal this.The supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction that one isloved; loved for one’s own sake—let us say rather, loved in spite ofone’s self; this conviction the blind man possesses.', 'To be served indistress is to be caressed.', 'Does he lack anything?', 'No.', 'One does notlose the sight when one has love.', 'And what love!', 'A love whollyconstituted of virtue!', 'There is no blindness where there is certainty.Soul seeks soul, gropingly, and finds it.', 'And this soul, found andtested, is a woman.', 'A hand sustains you; it is hers: a mouth lightlytouches your brow; it is her mouth: you hear a breath very near you; itis hers.', 'To have everything of her, from her worship to her pity, neverto be left, to have that sweet weakness aiding you, to lean upon thatimmovable reed, to touch Providence with one’s hands, and to be able totake it in one’s arms,—God made tangible,—what bliss!', 'The heart, thatobscure, celestial flower, undergoes a mysterious blossoming.', 'One wouldnot exchange that shadow for all brightness!', 'The angel soul is there,uninterruptedly there; if she departs, it is but to return again; shevanishes like a dream, and reappears like reality.', 'One feels warmthapproaching, and behold!', 'she is there.', 'One overflows with serenity,with gayety, with ecstasy; one is a radiance amid the night.', 'And thereare a thousand little cares.', 'Nothings, which are enormous in that void.The most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you,and supplying the vanished universe to you.', 'One is caressed with thesoul.', 'One sees nothing, but one feels that one is adored.', 'It is aparadise of shadows.It was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed to theother.The announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of M.sur M. On the following day, M. Madeleine appeared clad wholly inblack, and with crape on his hat.This mourning was noticed in the town, and commented on.', 'It seemed tothrow a light on M. Madeleine’s origin.', 'It was concluded that somerelationship existed between him and the venerable Bishop.', '_“He hasgone into mourning for the Bishop of D——”_ said the drawing-rooms; thisraised M. Madeleine’s credit greatly, and procured for him, instantlyand at one blow, a certain consideration in the noble world of M. surM.', 'The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain of the place meditatedraising the quarantine against M. Madeleine, the probable relative of abishop.', 'M. Madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained,by the more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentifulsmiles of the young ones.', 'One evening, a ruler in that petty greatworld, who was curious by right of seniority, ventured to ask him, “M.le Maire is doubtless a cousin of the late Bishop of D——?”He said, “No, Madame.”“But,” resumed the dowager, “you are wearing mourning for him.”He replied, “It is because I was a servant in his family in my youth.”Another thing which was remarked, was, that every time that heencountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about thecountry and seeking chimneys to sweep, the mayor had him summoned,inquired his name, and gave him money.', 'The little Savoyards told eachother about it: a great many of them passed that way.CHAPTER V—VAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZONLittle by little, and in the course of time, all this oppositionsubsided.', 'There had at first been exercised against M. Madeleine, invirtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to,blackening and calumnies; then they grew to be nothing more thanill-nature, then merely malicious remarks, then even this entirelydisappeared; respect became complete, unanimous, cordial, and towards1821 the moment arrived when the word “Monsieur le Maire” waspronounced at M. sur M. with almost the same accent as “Monseigneur theBishop” had been pronounced in D—— in 1815.', 'People came from a distanceof ten leagues around to consult M. Madeleine.', 'He put an end todifferences, he prevented lawsuits, he reconciled enemies.', 'Every onetook him for the judge, and with good reason.', 'It seemed as though hehad for a soul the book of the natural law.', 'It was like an epidemic ofveneration, which in the course of six or seven years gradually tookpossession of the whole district.One single man in the town, in the arrondissement, absolutely escapedthis contagion, and, whatever Father Madeleine did, remained hisopponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinctkept him on the alert and uneasy.', 'It seems, in fact, as though thereexisted in certain men a veritable bestial instinct, though pure andupright, like all instincts, which creates antipathies and sympathies,which fatally separates one nature from another nature, which does nothesitate, which feels no disquiet, which does not hold its peace, andwhich never belies itself, clear in its obscurity, infallible,imperious, intractable, stubborn to all counsels of the intelligenceand to all the dissolvents of reason, and which, in whatever mannerdestinies are arranged, secretly warns the man-dog of the presence ofthe man-cat, and the man-fox of the presence of the man-lion.It frequently happened that when M. Madeleine was passing along astreet, calm, affectionate, surrounded by the blessings of all, a manof lofty stature, clad in an iron-gray frock-coat, armed with a heavycane, and wearing a battered hat, turned round abruptly behind him, andfollowed him with his eyes until he disappeared, with folded arms and aslow shake of the head, and his upper lip raised in company with hislower to his nose, a sort of significant grimace which might betranslated by: “What is that man, after all?', 'I certainly have seen himsomewhere.', 'In any case, I am not his dupe.”This person, grave with a gravity which was almost menacing, was one ofthose men who, even when only seen by a rapid glimpse, arrest thespectator’s attention.His name was Javert, and he belonged to the police.At M. sur M. he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of aninspector.', 'He had not seen Madeleine’s beginnings.', 'Javert owed the postwhich he occupied to the protection of M. Chabouillet, the secretary ofthe Minister of State, Comte Anglès, then prefect of police at Paris.When Javert arrived at M. sur M. the fortune of the great manufacturerwas already made, and Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine.Certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy, which iscomplicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority.Javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness.It is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes, we shouldbe able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individualof the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animalcreation; and we could easily recognize this truth, hardly perceived bythe thinker, that from the oyster to the eagle, from the pig to thetiger, all animals exist in man, and that each one of them is in a man.Sometimes even several of them at a time.Animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices,straying before our eyes, the visible phantoms of our souls.', 'God showsthem to us in order to induce us to reflect.', 'Only since animals aremere shadows, God has not made them capable of education in the fullsense of the word; what is the use?', 'On the contrary, our souls beingrealities and having a goal which is appropriate to them, God hasbestowed on them intelligence; that is to say, the possibility ofeducation.', 'Social education, when well done, can always draw from asoul, of whatever sort it may be, the utility which it contains.This, be it said, is of course from the restricted point of view of theterrestrial life which is apparent, and without prejudging the profoundquestion of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings whichare not man.', 'The visible _I_ in nowise authorizes the thinker to denythe latent _I_.', 'Having made this reservation, let us pass on.Now, if the reader will admit, for a moment, with us, that in every manthere is one of the animal species of creation, it will be easy for usto say what there was in Police Officer Javert.The peasants of Asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolvesthere is one dog, which is killed by the mother because, otherwise, ashe grew up, he would devour the other little ones.Give to this dog-son of a wolf a human face, and the result will beJavert.Javert had been born in prison, of a fortune-teller, whose husband wasin the galleys.', 'As he grew up, he thought that he was outside the paleof society, and he despaired of ever re-entering it.', 'He observed thatsociety unpardoningly excludes two classes of men,—those who attack itand those who guard it; he had no choice except between these twoclasses; at the same time, he was conscious of an indescribablefoundation of rigidity, regularity, and probity, complicated with aninexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung.', 'Heentered the police; he succeeded there.', 'At forty years of age he was aninspector.During his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments ofthe South.Before proceeding further, let us come to an understanding as to thewords, “human face,” which we have just applied to Javert.The human face of Javert consisted of a flat nose, with two deepnostrils, towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks.', 'Onefelt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two cavernsfor the first time.', 'When Javert laughed,—and his laugh was rare andterrible,—his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth,but his gums, and around his nose there formed a flattened and savagefold, as on the muzzle of a wild beast.', 'Javert, serious, was awatchdog; when he laughed, he was a tiger.', 'As for the rest, he had verylittle skull and a great deal of jaw; his hair concealed his foreheadand fell over his eyebrows; between his eyes there was a permanent,central frown, like an imprint of wrath; his gaze was obscure; hismouth pursed up and terrible; his air that of ferocious command.This man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments,comparatively; but he rendered them almost bad, by dint of exaggeratingthem,—respect for authority, hatred of rebellion; and in his eyes,murder, robbery, all crimes, are only forms of rebellion.', 'He envelopedin a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in thestate, from the prime minister to the rural policeman.', 'He covered withscorn, aversion, and disgust every one who had once crossed the legalthreshold of evil.', 'He was absolute, and admitted no exceptions.', 'On theone hand, he said, “The functionary can make no mistake; the magistrateis never the wrong.” On the other hand, he said, “These men areirremediably lost.', 'Nothing good can come from them.” He fully sharedthe opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law I knownot what power of making, or, if the reader will have it so, ofauthenticating, demons, and who place a Styx at the base of society.', 'Hewas stoical, serious, austere; a melancholy dreamer, humble andhaughty, like fanatics.', 'His glance was like a gimlet, cold andpiercing.', 'His whole life hung on these two words: watchfulness andsupervision.', 'He had introduced a straight line into what is the mostcrooked thing in the world; he possessed the conscience of hisusefulness, the religion of his functions, and he was a spy as othermen are priests.', 'Woe to the man who fell into his hands!', 'He would havearrested his own father, if the latter had escaped from the galleys,and would have denounced his mother, if she had broken her ban.', 'And hewould have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which isconferred by virtue.', 'And, withal, a life of privation, isolation,abnegation, chastity, with never a diversion.', 'It was implacable duty;the police understood, as the Spartans understood Sparta, a pitilesslying in wait, a ferocious honesty, a marble informer, Brutus inVidocq.Javert’s whole person was expressive of the man who spies and whowithdraws himself from observation.', 'The mystical school of Joseph deMaistre, which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those thingswhich were called the ultra newspapers, would not have failed todeclare that Javert was a symbol.', 'His brow was not visible; itdisappeared beneath his hat: his eyes were not visible, since they werelost under his eyebrows: his chin was not visible, for it was plungedin his cravat: his hands were not visible; they were drawn up in hissleeves: and his cane was not visible; he carried it under his coat.But when the occasion presented itself, there was suddenly seen toemerge from all this shadow, as from an ambuscade, a narrow and angularforehead, a baleful glance, a threatening chin, enormous hands, and amonstrous cudgel.In his leisure moments, which were far from frequent, he read, althoughhe hated books; this caused him to be not wholly illiterate.', 'This couldbe recognized by some emphasis in his speech.As we have said, he had no vices.', 'When he was pleased with himself, hepermitted himself a pinch of snuff.', 'Therein lay his connection withhumanity.The reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert was theterror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the Ministryof Justice designates under the rubric, Vagrants.', 'The name of Javertrouted them by its mere utterance; the face of Javert petrified them atsight.Such was this formidable man.Javert was like an eye constantly fixed on M. Madeleine.', 'An eye full ofsuspicion and conjecture.', 'M. Madeleine had finally perceived the fact;but it seemed to be of no importance to him.', 'He did not even put aquestion to Javert; he neither sought nor avoided him; he bore thatembarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it.He treated Javert with ease and courtesy, as he did all the rest of theworld.It was divined, from some words which escaped Javert, that he hadsecretly investigated, with that curiosity which belongs to the race,and into which there enters as much instinct as will, all the anteriortraces which Father Madeleine might have left elsewhere.', 'He seemed toknow, and he sometimes said in covert words, that some one had gleanedcertain information in a certain district about a family which haddisappeared.', 'Once he chanced to say, as he was talking to himself, “Ithink I have him!” Then he remained pensive for three days, and utterednot a word.', 'It seemed that the thread which he thought he held hadbroken.Moreover, and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the tooabsolute sense which certain words might present, there can be nothingreally infallible in a human creature, and the peculiarity of instinctis that it can become confused, thrown off the track, and defeated.Otherwise, it would be superior to intelligence, and the beast would befound to be provided with a better light than man.Javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalnessand tranquillity of M. Madeleine.One day, nevertheless, his strange manner appeared to produce animpression on M. Madeleine.', 'It was on the following occasion.CHAPTER VI—FATHER FAUCHELEVENTOne morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of M.', 'surM.', '; he heard a noise, and saw a group some distance away.', 'Heapproached.', 'An old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallenbeneath his cart, his horse having tumbled down.This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had atthat time.', 'When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, anex-notary and a peasant who was almost educated, had a business whichwas beginning to be in a bad way.', 'Fauchelevent had seen this simpleworkman grow rich, while he, a lawyer, was being ruined.', 'This hadfilled him with jealousy, and he had done all he could, on everyoccasion, to injure Madeleine.', 'Then bankruptcy had come; and as the oldman had nothing left but a cart and a horse, and neither family norchildren, he had turned carter.The horse had two broken legs and could not rise.', 'The old man wascaught in the wheels.', 'The fall had been so unlucky that the wholeweight of the vehicle rested on his breast.', 'The cart was quite heavilyladen.', 'Father Fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the mostlamentable manner.', 'They had tried, but in vain, to drag him out.', 'Anunmethodical effort, aid awkwardly given, a wrong shake, might killhim.', 'It was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting thevehicle off of him.', 'Javert, who had come up at the moment of theaccident, had sent for a jack-screw.M.', 'Madeleine arrived.', 'People stood aside respectfully.“Help!” cried old Fauchelevent.', '“Who will be good and save the oldman?”M.', 'Madeleine turned towards those present:—“Is there a jack-screw to be had?”“One has been sent for,” answered the peasant.“How long will it take to get it?”“They have gone for the nearest, to Flachot’s place, where there is afarrier; but it makes no difference; it will take a good quarter of anhour.”“A quarter of an hour!” exclaimed Madeleine.It had rained on the preceding night; the soil was soaked.The cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment, and crushingthe old carter’s breast more and more.', 'It was evident that his ribswould be broken in five minutes more.“It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour,” said Madeleineto the peasants, who were staring at him.“We must!”“But it will be too late then!', 'Don’t you see that the cart is sinking?”“Well!”“Listen,” resumed Madeleine; “there is still room enough under the cartto allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back.', 'Onlyhalf a minute, and the poor man can be taken out.', 'Is there any one herewho has stout loins and heart?', 'There are five louis d’or to be earned!”Not a man in the group stirred.“Ten louis,” said Madeleine.The persons present dropped their eyes.', 'One of them muttered: “A manwould need to be devilish strong.', 'And then he runs the risk of gettingcrushed!”“Come,” began Madeleine again, “twenty louis.”The same silence.“It is not the will which is lacking,” said a voice.M.', 'Madeleine turned round, and recognized Javert.', 'He had not noticedhim on his arrival.Javert went on:—“It is strength.', 'One would have to be a terrible man to do such a thingas lift a cart like that on his back.”Then, gazing fixedly at M. Madeleine, he went on, emphasizing everyword that he uttered:—“Monsieur Madeleine, I have never known but one man capable of doingwhat you ask.”Madeleine shuddered.Javert added, with an air of indifference, but without removing hiseyes from Madeleine:—“He was a convict.”“Ah!” said Madeleine.“In the galleys at Toulon.”Madeleine turned pale.Meanwhile, the cart continued to sink slowly.', 'Father Faucheleventrattled in the throat, and shrieked:—“I am strangling!', 'My ribs are breaking!', 'a screw!', 'something!', 'Ah!”Madeleine glanced about him.“Is there, then, no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save thelife of this poor old man?”No one stirred.', 'Javert resumed:—“I have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw,and he was that convict.”“Ah!', 'It is crushing me!” cried the old man.Madeleine raised his head, met Javert’s falcon eye still fixed uponhim, looked at the motionless peasants, and smiled sadly.', 'Then, withoutsaying a word, he fell on his knees, and before the crowd had even hadtime to utter a cry, he was underneath the vehicle.A terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued.They beheld Madeleine, almost flat on his stomach beneath that terribleweight, make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbowstogether.', 'They shouted to him, “Father Madeleine, come out!” OldFauchelevent himself said to him, “Monsieur Madeleine, go away!', 'You seethat I am fated to die!', 'Leave me!', 'You will get yourself crushed also!”Madeleine made no reply.All the spectators were panting.', 'The wheels had continued to sink, andit had become almost impossible for Madeleine to make his way fromunder the vehicle.Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly,the wheels half emerged from the ruts.', 'They heard a stifled voicecrying, “Make haste!', 'Help!” It was Madeleine, who had just made a finaleffort.They rushed forwards.', 'The devotion of a single man had given force andcourage to all.', 'The cart was raised by twenty arms.', 'Old Faucheleventwas saved.Madeleine rose.', 'He was pale, though dripping with perspiration.', 'Hisclothes were torn and covered with mud.', 'All wept.', 'The old man kissedhis knees and called him the good God.', 'As for him, he bore upon hiscountenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestialsuffering, and he fixed his tranquil eye on Javert, who was stillstaring at him.CHAPTER VII—FAUCHELEVENT BECOMES A GARDENER IN PARISFauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall.', 'Father Madeleinehad him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for hisworkmen in the factory building itself, and which was served by twosisters of charity.', 'On the following morning the old man found athousand-franc bank-note on his night-stand, with these words in FatherMadeleine’s writing: _“I purchase your horse and cart.”_ The cart wasbroken, and the horse was dead.', 'Fauchelevent recovered, but his kneeremained stiff.', 'M. Madeleine, on the recommendation of the sisters ofcharity and of his priest, got the good man a place as gardener in afemale convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris.Some time afterwards, M. Madeleine was appointed mayor.', 'The first timethat Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave himauthority over the town, he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dogmight experience on smelling a wolf in his master’s clothes.', 'From thattime forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could.', 'When therequirements of the service imperatively demanded it, and he could notdo otherwise than meet the mayor, he addressed him with profoundrespect.This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, besidesthe visible signs which we have mentioned, another symptom which wasnonetheless significant for not being visible.', 'This never deceives.When the population suffers, when work is lacking, when there is nocommerce, the tax-payer resists imposts through penury, he exhausts andoversteps his respite, and the state expends a great deal of money inthe charges for compelling and collection.', 'When work is abundant, whenthe country is rich and happy, the taxes are paid easily and cost thestate nothing.', 'It may be said, that there is one infallible thermometerof the public misery and riches,—the cost of collecting the taxes.', 'Inthe course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes haddiminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., and thisled to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest byM.', 'de Villèle, then Minister of Finance.Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither.', 'Noone remembered her.', 'Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine’s factory waslike the face of a friend.', 'She presented herself there, and wasadmitted to the women’s workroom.', 'The trade was entirely new toFantine; she could not be very skilful at it, and she therefore earnedbut little by her day’s work; but it was sufficient; the problem wassolved; she was earning her living.CHAPTER VIII—MADAME VICTURNIEN EXPENDS THIRTY FRANCS ON MORALITYWhen Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for amoment.', 'To live honestly by her own labor, what mercy from heaven!', 'Thetaste for work had really returned to her.', 'She bought a looking-glass,took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, herfine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and ofthe possible future, and was almost happy.', 'She hired a little room andfurnished on credit on the strength of her future work—a lingeringtrace of her improvident ways.', 'As she was not able to say that she wasmarried she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her littlegirl.At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thénardiers promptly.', 'Asshe only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through apublic letter-writer.She wrote often, and this was noticed.', 'It began to be said in anundertone, in the women’s workroom, that Fantine “wrote letters” andthat “she had ways about her.”There is no one for spying on people’s actions like those who are notconcerned in them.', 'Why does that gentleman never come except atnightfall?', 'Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail onTuesday?', 'Why does he always take the narrow streets?', 'Why does Madamealways descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house?', 'Whydoes she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper, when she has a“whole stationer’s shop full of it?” etc.', 'There exist beings who, forthe sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, ofno consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time,take more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, andthat gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any otherpayment for their curiosity than curiosity.', 'They will follow up suchand such a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty forhours at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors atnight, in cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will makethe drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid,suborn a porter.', 'Why?', 'For no reason.', 'A pure passion for seeing,knowing, and penetrating into things.', 'A pure itch for talking.', 'Andoften these secrets once known, these mysteries made public, theseenigmas illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophies, duels,failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy ofthose who have “found out everything,” without any interest in thematter, and by pure instinct.', 'A sad thing.Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking.Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of theanteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they needa great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished bytheir neighbors.So Fantine was watched.In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her whiteteeth.It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in themidst of the rest, to wipe away a tear.', 'These were the moments when shewas thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she hadloved.Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that shepaid the carriage on the letter.', 'They managed to obtain the address:_Monsieur, Monsieur Thénardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil_.', 'The publicwriter, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red winewithout emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in thewine-shop.', 'In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child.', '“Shemust be a pretty sort of a woman.” An old gossip was found, who madethe trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thénardiers, and said on herreturn: “For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind.', 'I haveseen the child.”The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, theguardian and door-keeper of every one’s virtue.', 'Madame Victurnien wasfifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age.', 'Aquavering voice, a whimsical mind.', 'This old dame had once beenyoung—astonishing fact!', 'In her youth, in ’93, she had married a monkwho had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from theBernardines to the Jacobins.', 'She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp,captious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widowshe was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to hiswill.', 'She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible.At the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energythat the priests had forgiven her her monk.', 'She had a small property,which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community.She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras.', 'So this MadameVicturnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with the remark, “I haveseen the child.”All this took time.', 'Fantine had been at the factory for more than ayear, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed herfifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employedin the shop, and requested her, in the mayor’s name, to leave theneighborhood.This was the very month when the Thénardiers, after having demandedtwelve francs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs insteadof twelve.Fantine was overwhelmed.', 'She could not leave the neighborhood; she wasin debt for her rent and furniture.', 'Fifty francs was not sufficient tocancel this debt.', 'She stammered a few supplicating words.', 'Thesuperintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant.', 'Besides,Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman.', 'Overcome with shame, evenmore than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room.So her fault was now known to every one.She no longer felt strong enough to say a word.', 'She was advised to seethe mayor; she did not dare.', 'The mayor had given her fifty francsbecause he was good, and had dismissed her because he was just.', 'Shebowed before the decision.CHAPTER IX—MADAME VICTURNIEN’S SUCCESSSo the monk’s widow was good for something.But M. Madeleine had heard nothing of all this.', 'Life is full of justsuch combinations of events.', 'M.

in fact, it is perfectlysimple: a man amuses himself by putting snow down a woman’s back, andthat makes the officers laugh; one must divert themselves in some way;and we—well, we are here for them to amuse themselves with, of course!And then, you, you come; you are certainly obliged to preserve order,you lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, sinceyou are a good man, you say that I am to be set at liberty; it is forthe sake of the little one, for six months in prison would prevent mysupporting my child.', '‘Only, don’t do it again, you hussy!’ Oh!', 'I won’tdo it again, Monsieur Javert!', 'They may do whatever they please to menow;

don’t be afraid—it is here.”She no longer wept, her voice was caressing; she placed Javert’s coarsehand on her delicate, white throat and looked smilingly at him.All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, dropped thefolds of her skirt, which had been pushed up as she dragged herselfalong, almost to the height of her knee, and stepped towards the door,saying to the soldiers in a low voice, and with a friendly nod:—“Children, Monsieur l’Inspecteur has said that I am to be released, andI am going.”She laid her hand on the latch of the door.', 'One step more and she wouldbe in the street.Javert up to that moment had remained erect, motionless, with his eyesfixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some displacedstatue, which is waiting to be put away somewhere.The sound of the latch roused him.', 'He raised his head with anexpression of sovereign authority, an expression all the more alarmingin proportion as the authority rests on a low level, ferocious in thewild beast, atrocious in the man of no estate.“Sergeant!” he cried, “don’t you see that that jade is walking off!', 'Whobade you let her go?”“I,” said Madeleine.Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert’s voice, and let go of thelatch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen.', 'At thesound of Madeleine’s voice she turned around, and from that momentforth she uttered no word, nor dared so much as to breathe freely, buther glance strayed from Madeleine to Javert, and from Javert toMadeleine in turn, according to which was speaking.It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measurebefore he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he haddone, after the mayor’s suggestion that Fantine should be set atliberty.', 'Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor’s presence?Had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any“authority” should have given such an order, and that the mayor mustcertainly have said one thing by mistake for another, without intendingit?', 'Or, in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness forthe past two hours, did he say to himself, that it was necessary torecur to supreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that the smallshould be made great, that the police spy should transform himself intoa magistrate, that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice,and that, in this prodigious extremity, order, law, morality,government, society in its entirety, was personified in him, Javert?However that may be, when M. Madeleine uttered that word, _I_, as wehave just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward themayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, and a look of despair, his wholebody agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedentedoccurrence, and say to him, with downcast eyes but a firm voice:—“Mr.', 'Mayor, that cannot be.”“Why not?” said M. Madeleine.“This miserable woman has insulted a citizen.”“Inspector Javert,” replied the mayor, in a calm and conciliating tone,“listen.', 'You are an honest man, and I feel no hesitation in explainingmatters to you.', 'Here is the true state of the case: I was passingthrough the square just as you were leading this woman away; there werestill groups of people standing about, and I made inquiries and learnedeverything; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who shouldhave been arrested by properly conducted police.”Javert retorted:—“This wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire.”“That concerns me,” said M. Madeleine.', '“My own insult belongs to me, Ithink.', 'I can do what I please about it.”“I beg Monsieur le Maire’s pardon.', 'The insult is not to him but to thelaw.”“Inspector Javert,” replied M. Madeleine, “the highest law isconscience.', 'I have heard this woman; I know what I am doing.”“And I, Mr. Mayor, do not know what I see.”“Then content yourself with obeying.”“I am obeying my duty.', 'My duty demands that this woman shall serve sixmonths in prison.”M.', 'Madeleine replied gently:—“Heed this well; she will not serve a single day.”At this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look on themayor and to say, but in a tone of voice that was still profoundlyrespectful:—“I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is for the first time in mylife, but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of myauthority.', 'I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire desires it, to thequestion of the gentleman.', 'I was present.', 'This woman flung herself onMonsieur Bamatabois, who is an elector and the proprietor of thathandsome house with a balcony, which forms the corner of the esplanade,three stories high and entirely of cut stone.', 'Such things as there arein the world!', 'In any case, Monsieur le Maire, this is a question ofpolice regulations in the streets, and concerns me, and I shall detainthis woman Fantine.”Then M. Madeleine folded his arms, and said in a severe voice which noone in the town had heard hitherto:—“The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipalpolice.', 'According to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, andsixty-six of the code of criminal examination, I am the judge.', 'I orderthat this woman shall be set at liberty.”Javert ventured to make a final effort.“But, Mr. Mayor—”“I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December,1799, in regard to arbitrary detention.”“Monsieur le Maire, permit me—”“Not another word.”“But—”“Leave the room,” said M. Madeleine.Javert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, like aRussian soldier.', 'He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and leftthe room.Fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as hepassed.Nevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion.', 'She hadjust seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers.', 'Shehad seen two men who held in their hands her liberty, her life, hersoul, her child, in combat before her very eyes; one of these men wasdrawing her towards darkness, the other was leading her back towardsthe light.', 'In this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations ofterror, these two men had appeared to her like two giants; the onespoke like her demon, the other like her good angel.', 'The angel hadconquered the demon, and, strange to say, that which made her shudderfrom head to foot was the fact that this angel, this liberator, was thevery man whom she abhorred, that mayor whom she had so long regarded asthe author of all her woes, that Madeleine!', 'And at the very moment whenshe had insulted him in so hideous a fashion, he had saved her!', 'Hadshe, then, been mistaken?', 'Must she change her whole soul?', 'She did notknow; she trembled.', 'She listened in bewilderment, she looked on inaffright, and at every word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt thefrightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her, and somethingwarm and ineffable, indescribable, which was both joy, confidence andlove, dawn in her heart.When Javert had taken his departure, M. Madeleine turned to her andsaid to her in a deliberate voice, like a serious man who does not wishto weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking:—“I have heard you.', 'I knew nothing about what you have mentioned.', 'Ibelieve that it is true, and I feel that it is true.', 'I was evenignorant of the fact that you had left my shop.', 'Why did you not applyto me?', 'But here; I will pay your debts, I will send for your child, oryou shall go to her.', 'You shall live here, in Paris, or where youplease.', 'I undertake the care of your child and yourself.', 'You shall notwork any longer if you do not like.', 'I will give all the money yourequire.', 'You shall be honest and happy once more.', 'And listen!', 'I declareto you that if all is as you say,—and I do not doubt it,—you have neverceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of God.', 'Oh!', 'poor woman.”This was more than Fantine could bear.', 'To have Cosette!', 'To leave thislife of infamy.', 'To live free, rich, happy, respectable with Cosette; tosee all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst ofher misery.', 'She stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her, andcould only give vent to two or three sobs, “Oh!', 'Oh!', 'Oh!”Her limbs gave way beneath her, she knelt in front of M.

Madeleine was in his study, occupied in arranging inadvance some pressing matters connected with the mayor’s office, incase he should decide to take the trip to Montfermeil, when he wasinformed that Police Inspector Javert was desirous of speaking withhim.', 'Madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression onhearing this name.', 'Javert had avoided him more than ever since theaffair of the police-station, and M. Madeleine had not seen him.“Admit him,” he said.Javert entered.M.', 'Madeleine had retained his seat near the fire, pen in hand, his eyesfixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating, and whichcontained the trials of the commission on highways for the infractionof police regulations.', 'He did not disturb himself on Javert’s account.He could not help thinking of poor Fantine, and it suited him to beglacial in his manner.Javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor, whose back was turnedto him.', 'The mayor did not look at him, but went on annotating thisdocket.Javert advanced two or three paces into the study, and halted, withoutbreaking the silence.If any physiognomist who had been familiar with Javert, and who hadmade a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization,this singular composite of the Roman, the Spartan, the monk, and thecorporal, this spy who was incapable of a lie, this unspotted policeagent—if any physiognomist had known his secret and long-cherishedaversion for M. Madeleine, his conflict with the mayor on the subjectof Fantine, and had examined Javert at that moment, he would have saidto himself, “What has taken place?” It was evident to any oneacquainted with that clear, upright, sincere, honest, austere, andferocious conscience, that Javert had but just gone through some greatinterior struggle.', 'Javert had nothing in his soul which he had not alsoin his countenance.', 'Like violent people in general, he was subject toabrupt changes of opinion.', 'His physiognomy had never been more peculiarand startling.', 'On entering he bowed to M. Madeleine with a look inwhich there was neither rancor, anger, nor distrust; he halted a fewpaces in the rear of the mayor’s armchair, and there he stood,perfectly erect, in an attitude almost of discipline, with the cold,ingenuous roughness of a man who has never been gentle and who hasalways been patient; he waited without uttering a word, without makinga movement, in genuine humility and tranquil resignation, calm,serious, hat in hand, with eyes cast down, and an expression which washalf-way between that of a soldier in the presence of his officer and acriminal in the presence of his judge, until it should please the mayorto turn round.', 'All the sentiments as well as all the memories which onemight have attributed to him had disappeared.', 'That face, asimpenetrable and simple as granite, no longer bore any trace ofanything but a melancholy depression.', 'His whole person breathedlowliness and firmness and an indescribable courageous despondency.At last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round.“Well!', 'What is it?', 'What is the matter, Javert?”Javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas,then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity, which did not,however, preclude simplicity.“This is the matter, Mr. Mayor; a culpable act has been committed.”“What act?”“An inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect, and in thegravest manner, towards a magistrate.', 'I have come to bring the fact toyour knowledge, as it is my duty to do.”“Who is the agent?” asked M. Madeleine.“I,” said Javert.“You?”“I.”“And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?”“You, Mr. Mayor.”M.', 'Madeleine sat erect in his armchair.', 'Javert went on, with a severeair and his eyes still cast down.“Mr.', 'Mayor, I have come to request you to instigate the authorities todismiss me.”M.', 'Madeleine opened his mouth in amazement.', 'Javert interrupted him:—“You will say that I might have handed in my resignation, but that doesnot suffice.', 'Handing in one’s resignation is honorable.', 'I have failedin my duty; I ought to be punished; I must be turned out.”And after a pause he added:—“Mr.', 'Mayor, you were severe with me the other day, and unjustly.', 'Be soto-day, with justice.”“Come, now!', 'Why?” exclaimed M. Madeleine.', '“What nonsense is this?', 'Whatis the meaning of this?', 'What culpable act have you been guilty oftowards me?', 'What have you done to me?', 'What are your wrongs with regardto me?', 'You accuse yourself; you wish to be superseded—”“Turned out,” said Javert.“Turned out; so it be, then.', 'That is well.', 'I do not understand.”“You shall understand, Mr. Mayor.”Javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest, and resumed, stillcoldly and sadly:—“Mr.', 'Mayor, six weeks ago, in consequence of the scene over that woman,I was furious, and I informed against you.”“Informed against me!”“At the Prefecture of Police in Paris.”M.', 'Madeleine, who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener thanJavert himself, burst out laughing now:—“As a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police?”“As an ex-convict.”The mayor turned livid.Javert, who had not raised his eyes, went on:—“I thought it was so.', 'I had had an idea for a long time; a resemblance;inquiries which you had caused to be made at Faverolles; the strengthof your loins; the adventure with old Fauchelevant; your skill inmarksmanship; your leg, which you drag a little;—I hardly know whatall,—absurdities!', 'But, at all events, I took you for a certain JeanValjean.”“A certain—What did you say the name was?”“Jean Valjean.', 'He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeingtwenty years ago, when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon.', 'Onleaving the galleys, this Jean Valjean, as it appears, robbed a bishop;then he committed another theft, accompanied with violence, on a publichighway on the person of a little Savoyard.', 'He disappeared eight yearsago, no one knows how, and he has been sought, I fancied.', 'In short, Idid this thing!', 'Wrath impelled me; I denounced you at the Prefecture!”M.', 'Madeleine, who had taken up the docket again several moments beforethis, resumed with an air of perfect indifference:—“And what reply did you receive?”“That I was mad.”“Well?”“Well, they were right.”“It is lucky that you recognize the fact.”“I am forced to do so, since the real Jean Valjean has been found.”The sheet of paper which M. Madeleine was holding dropped from hishand; he raised his head, gazed fixedly at Javert, and said with hisindescribable accent:—“Ah!”Javert continued:—“This is the way it is, Mr. Mayor.', 'It seems that there was in theneighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was calledFather Champmathieu.', 'He was a very wretched creature.', 'No one paid anyattention to him.', 'No one knows what such people subsist on.', 'Lately,last autumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of somecider apples from—Well, no matter, a theft had been committed, a wallscaled, branches of trees broken.', 'My Champmathieu was arrested.', 'Hestill had the branch of apple-tree in his hand.', 'The scamp is locked up.Up to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor.', 'But here iswhere Providence intervened.“The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds itconvenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmentalprison is situated.', 'In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convictnamed Brevet, who is detained for I know not what, and who has beenappointed turnkey of the house, because of good behavior.', 'Mr. Mayor, nosooner had Champmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: ‘Eh!', 'Why, I knowthat man!', 'He is a _fagot!_4 Take a good look at me, my good man!', 'Youare Jean Valjean!’ ‘Jean Valjean!', 'who’s Jean Valjean?’ Champmathieufeigns astonishment.', '‘Don’t play the innocent dodge,’ says Brevet.', '‘Youare Jean Valjean!', 'You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twentyyears ago; we were there together.’ Champmathieu denies it.', 'Parbleu!You understand.', 'The case is investigated.', 'The thing was well ventilatedfor me.', 'This is what they discovered: This Champmathieu had been,thirty years ago, a pruner of trees in various localities, notably atFaverolles.', 'There all trace of him was lost.', 'A long time afterwards hewas seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he is said to havebeen a wheelwright, and to have had a daughter, who was a laundress;but that has not been proved.', 'Now, before going to the galleys fortheft, what was Jean Valjean?', 'A pruner of trees.', 'Where?', 'At Faverolles.Another fact.', 'This Valjean’s Christian name was Jean, and his mother’ssurname was Mathieu.', 'What more natural to suppose than that, onemerging from the galleys, he should have taken his mother’s name forthe purpose of concealing himself, and have called himself JeanMathieu?', 'He goes to Auvergne.', 'The local pronunciation turns _Jean_ into_Chan_—he is called Chan Mathieu.', 'Our man offers no opposition, andbehold him transformed into Champmathieu.', 'You follow me, do you not?Inquiries were made at Faverolles.', 'The family of Jean Valjean is nolonger there.', 'It is not known where they have gone.', 'You know that amongthose classes a family often disappears.', 'Search was made, and nothingwas found.', 'When such people are not mud, they are dust.', 'And then, asthe beginning of the story dates thirty years back, there is no longerany one at Faverolles who knew Jean Valjean.', 'Inquiries were made atToulon.', 'Besides Brevet, there are only two convicts in existence whohave seen Jean Valjean; they are Cochepaille and Chenildieu, and aresentenced for life.', 'They are taken from the galleys and confronted withthe pretended Champmathieu.', 'They do not hesitate; he is Jean Valjeanfor them as well as for Brevet.', 'The same age,—he is fifty-four,—thesame height, the same air, the same man; in short, it is he.', 'It wasprecisely at this moment that I forwarded my denunciation to thePrefecture in Paris.', 'I was told that I had lost my reason, and thatJean Valjean is at Arras, in the power of the authorities.', 'You canimagine whether this surprised me, when I thought that I had that sameJean Valjean here.', 'I write to the examining judge; he sends for me;Champmathieu is conducted to me—”“Well?” interposed M.

Madeleine, “that the matter concerns me.”But Javert, heeding his own thought only, continued:—“So far as exaggeration is concerned, I am not exaggerating.', 'This isthe way I reason: I have suspected you unjustly.', 'That is nothing.', 'It isour right to cherish suspicion, although suspicion directed aboveourselves is an abuse.', 'But without proofs, in a fit of rage, with theobject of wreaking my vengeance, I have denounced you as a convict,you, a respectable man, a mayor, a magistrate!', 'That is serious, veryserious.', 'I have insulted authority in your person, I, an agent of theauthorities!', 'If one of my subordinates had done what I have done, Ishould have declared him unworthy of the service, and have expelledhim.', 'Well?', 'Stop, Mr. Mayor; one word more.', 'I have often been severe inthe course of my life towards others.', 'That is just.', 'I have done well.Now, if I were not severe towards myself, all the justice that I havedone would become injustice.', 'Ought I to spare myself more than others?No!', 'What!', 'I should be good for nothing but to chastise others, and notmyself!', 'Why, I should be a blackguard!', 'Those who say, ‘That blackguardof a Javert!’ would be in the right.', 'Mr. Mayor, I do not desire thatyou should treat me kindly; your kindness roused sufficient bad bloodin me when it was directed to others.', 'I want none of it for myself.', 'Thekindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against acitizen, the police agent against the mayor, the man who is downagainst the man who is up in the world, is what I call false kindness.That is the sort of kindness which disorganizes society.', 'Good God!', 'itis very easy to be kind; the difficulty lies in being just.', 'Come!', 'ifyou had been what I thought you, I should not have been kind to you,not I!', 'You would have seen!', 'Mr. Mayor, I must treat myself as I wouldtreat any other man.', 'When I have subdued malefactors, when I haveproceeded with vigor against rascals, I have often said to myself, ‘Ifyou flinch, if I ever catch you in fault, you may rest at your ease!’ Ihave flinched, I have caught myself in a fault.', 'So much the worse!Come, discharged, cashiered, expelled!', 'That is well.', 'I have arms.', 'Iwill till the soil; it makes no difference to me.', 'Mr. Mayor, the goodof the service demands an example.', 'I simply require the discharge ofInspector Javert.”All this was uttered in a proud, humble, despairing, yet convincedtone, which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular, honest man.“We shall see,” said M. Madeleine.And he offered him his hand.Javert recoiled, and said in a wild voice:—“Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but this must not be.', 'A mayor does not offer hishand to a police spy.”He added between his teeth:—“A police spy, yes; from the moment when I have misused the police.', 'Iam no more than a police spy.”Then he bowed profoundly, and directed his steps towards the door.There he wheeled round, and with eyes still downcast:—“Mr.', 'Mayor,” he said, “I shall continue to serve until I amsuperseded.”He withdrew.', 'M. Madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm,sure step, which died away on the pavement of the corridor.BOOK SEVENTH—THE CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIRCHAPTER I—SISTER SIMPLICEThe incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at M.sur M. But the small portion of them which became known left such amemory in that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if wedid not narrate them in their most minute details.', 'Among these detailsthe reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances, whichwe preserve out of respect for the truth.On the afternoon following the visit of Javert, M. Madeleine went tosee Fantine according to his wont.Before entering Fantine’s room, he had Sister Simplice summoned.The two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary,Lazariste ladies, like all sisters of charity, bore the names of SisterPerpétue and Sister Simplice.Sister Perpétue was an ordinary villager, a sister of charity in acoarse style, who had entered the service of God as one enters anyother service.', 'She was a nun as other women are cooks.', 'This type is notso very rare.', 'The monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasantearthenware, which is easily fashioned into a Capuchin or an Ursuline.These rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion.', 'Thetransition from a drover to a Carmelite is not in the least violent;the one turns into the other without much effort; the fund of ignorancecommon to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand,and places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk: a littlemore amplitude in the smock, and it becomes a frock.', 'Sister Perpétuewas a robust nun from Marines near Pontoise, who chattered her patois,droned, grumbled, sugared the potion according to the bigotry or thehypocrisy of the invalid, treated her patients abruptly, roughly, wascrabbed with the dying, almost flung God in their faces, stoned theirdeath agony with prayers mumbled in a rage; was bold, honest, andruddy.Sister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor.', 'Beside Sister Perpétue,she was the taper beside the candle.', 'Vincent de Paul has divinelytraced the features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words,in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude: “They shall have fortheir convent only the house of the sick; for cell only a hired room;for chapel only their parish church; for cloister only the streets ofthe town and the wards of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience;for gratings only the fear of God; for veil only modesty.” This idealwas realized in the living person of Sister Simplice: she had neverbeen young, and it seemed as though she would never grow old.', 'No onecould have told Sister Simplice’s age.', 'She was a person—we dare not saya woman—who was gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, and who had neverlied.', 'She was so gentle that she appeared fragile; but she was moresolid than granite.', 'She touched the unhappy with fingers that werecharmingly pure and fine.', 'There was, so to speak, silence in herspeech; she said just what was necessary, and she possessed a tone ofvoice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted adrawing-room.', 'This delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown,finding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and ofGod.', 'Let us emphasize one detail.', 'Never to have lied, never to havesaid, for any interest whatever, even in indifference, any single thingwhich was not the truth, the sacred truth, was Sister Simplice’sdistinctive trait; it was the accent of her virtue.', 'She was almostrenowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity.', 'The AbbéSicard speaks of Sister Simplice in a letter to the deaf-mute Massieu.However pure and sincere we may be, we all bear upon our candor thecrack of the little, innocent lie.', 'She did not.', 'Little lie, innocentlie—does such a thing exist?', 'To lie is the absolute form of evil.', 'Tolie a little is not possible: he who lies, lies the whole lie.', 'To lieis the very face of the demon.', 'Satan has two names; he is called Satanand Lying.', 'That is what she thought; and as she thought, so she did.The result was the whiteness which we have mentioned—a whiteness whichcovered even her lips and her eyes with radiance.', 'Her smile was white,her glance was white.', 'There was not a single spider’s web, not a grainof dust, on the glass window of that conscience.', 'On entering the orderof Saint Vincent de Paul, she had taken the name of Simplice by specialchoice.', 'Simplice of Sicily, as we know, is the saint who preferred toallow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she hadbeen born at Segesta when she had been born at Syracuse—a lie whichwould have saved her.', 'This patron saint suited this soul.Sister Simplice, on her entrance into the order, had had two faultswhich she had gradually corrected: she had a taste for dainties, andshe liked to receive letters.', 'She never read anything but a book ofprayers printed in Latin, in coarse type.', 'She did not understand Latin,but she understood the book.This pious woman had conceived an affection for Fantine, probablyfeeling a latent virtue there, and she had devoted herself almostexclusively to her care.M.', 'Madeleine took Sister Simplice apart and recommended Fantine to herin a singular tone, which the sister recalled later on.On leaving the sister, he approached Fantine.Fantine awaited M. Madeleine’s appearance every day as one awaits a rayof warmth and joy.', 'She said to the sisters, “I only live when Monsieurle Maire is here.”She had a great deal of fever that day.', 'As soon as she saw M. Madeleineshe asked him:—“And Cosette?”He replied with a smile:—“Soon.”M.', 'Madeleine was the same as usual with Fantine.', 'Only he remained anhour instead of half an hour, to Fantine’s great delight.', 'He urgedevery one repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything.', 'Itwas noticed that there was a moment when his countenance became verysombre.', 'But this was explained when it became known that the doctor hadbent down to his ear and said to him, “She is losing ground fast.”Then he returned to the town-hall, and the clerk observed himattentively examining a road map of France which hung in his study.', 'Hewrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil.CHAPTER II—THE PERSPICACITY OF MASTER SCAUFFLAIREFrom the town-hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town, to aFleming named Master Scaufflaer, French Scaufflaire, who let out“horses and cabriolets as desired.”In order to reach this Scaufflaire, the shortest way was to take thelittle-frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of theparish in which M. Madeleine resided.', 'The curé was, it was said, aworthy, respectable, and sensible man.', 'At the moment when M. Madeleinearrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passer-by in thestreet, and this person noticed this: After the mayor had passed thepriest’s house he halted, stood motionless, then turned about, andretraced his steps to the door of the parsonage, which had an ironknocker.', 'He laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it; then hepaused again and stopped short, as though in thought, and after thelapse of a few seconds, instead of allowing the knocker to fallabruptly, he placed it gently, and resumed his way with a sort of hastewhich had not been apparent previously.M.', 'Madeleine found Master Scaufflaire at home, engaged in stitching aharness over.“Master Scaufflaire,” he inquired, “have you a good horse?”“Mr.', 'Mayor,” said the Fleming, “all my horses are good.', 'What do youmean by a good horse?”“I mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day.”“The deuce!” said the Fleming.', '“Twenty leagues!”“Yes.”“Hitched to a cabriolet?”“Yes.”“And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?”“He must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary.”“To traverse the same road?”“Yes.”“The deuce!', 'the deuce!', 'And it is twenty leagues?”M.', 'Madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilledsome figures.', 'He showed it to the Fleming.', 'The figures were 5, 6, 8½.“You see,” he said, “total, nineteen and a half; as well say twentyleagues.”“Mr.', 'Mayor,” returned the Fleming, “I have just what you want.', 'Mylittle white horse—you may have seen him pass occasionally; he is asmall beast from Lower Boulonnais.', 'He is full of fire.', 'They wanted tomake a saddle-horse of him at first.', 'Bah!', 'He reared, he kicked, he laideverybody flat on the ground.', 'He was thought to be vicious, and no oneknew what to do with him.', 'I bought him.', 'I harnessed him to a carriage.That is what he wanted, sir; he is as gentle as a girl; he goes likethe wind.', 'Ah!', 'indeed he must not be mounted.', 'It does not suit his ideasto be a saddle-horse.', 'Every one has his ambition.', '‘Draw?', 'Yes.', 'Carry?No.’ We must suppose that is what he said to himself.”“And he will accomplish the trip?”“Your twenty leagues all at a full trot, and in less than eight hours.But here are the conditions.”“State them.”“In the first place, you will give him half an hour’s breathing spellmidway of the road; he will eat; and some one must be by while he iseating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats; forI have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stablemen than eaten by the horses.”“Some one will be by.”“In the second place—is the cabriolet for Monsieur le Maire?”“Yes.”“Does Monsieur le Maire know how to drive?”“Yes.”“Well, Monsieur le Maire will travel alone and without baggage, inorder not to overload the horse?”“Agreed.”“But as Monsieur le Maire will have no one with him, he will be obligedto take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen.”“That is understood.”“I am to have thirty francs a day.', 'The days of rest to be paid foralso—not a farthing less; and the beast’s food to be at Monsieur leMaire’s expense.”M.', 'Madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on thetable.“Here is the pay for two days in advance.”“Fourthly, for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy, and wouldfatigue the horse.', 'Monsieur le Maire must consent to travel in a littletilbury that I own.”“I consent to that.”“It is light, but it has no cover.”“That makes no difference to me.”“Has Monsieur le Maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter?”M.', 'Madeleine did not reply.', 'The Fleming resumed:—“That it is very cold?”M.', 'Madeleine preserved silence.Master Scaufflaire continued:—“That it may rain?”M.', 'Madeleine raised his head and said:—“The tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door to-morrowmorning at half-past four o’clock.”“Of course, Monsieur le Maire,” replied Scaufflaire; then, scratching aspeck in the wood of the table with his thumb-nail, he resumed withthat careless air which the Flemings understand so well how to minglewith their shrewdness:—“But this is what I am thinking of now: Monsieur le Maire has not toldme where he is going.', 'Where is Monsieur le Maire going?”He had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of theconversation, but he did not know why he had not dared to put thequestion.“Are your horse’s forelegs good?” said M. Madeleine.“Yes, Monsieur le Maire.', 'You must hold him in a little when going downhill.', 'Are there many descends between here and the place whither youare going?”“Do not forget to be at my door at precisely half-past four o’clockto-morrow morning,” replied M. Madeleine; and he took his departure.The Fleming remained “utterly stupid,” as he himself said some timeafterwards.The mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door openedagain; it was the mayor once more.He still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air.“Monsieur Scaufflaire,” said he, “at what sum do you estimate the valueof the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me,—the one bearingthe other?”“The one dragging the other, Monsieur le Maire,” said the Fleming, witha broad smile.“So be it.', 'Well?”“Does Monsieur le Maire wish to purchase them or me?”“No; but I wish to guarantee you in any case.', 'You shall give me backthe sum at my return.', 'At what value do you estimate your horse andcabriolet?”“Five hundred francs, Monsieur le Maire.”“Here it is.”M.', 'Madeleine laid a bank-bill on the table, then left the room; andthis time he did not return.Master Scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not saida thousand francs.', 'Besides the horse and tilbury together were worthbut a hundred crowns.The Fleming called his wife, and related the affair to her.', '“Where thedevil could Monsieur le Maire be going?” They held counsel together.“He is going to Paris,” said the wife.', '“I don’t believe it,” said thehusband.M.', 'Madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it, and it layon the chimney-piece.', 'The Fleming picked it up and studied it.', '“Five,six, eight and a half?', 'That must designate the posting relays.” Heturned to his wife:—“I have found out.”“What?”“It is five leagues from here to Hesdin, six from Hesdin to Saint-Pol,eight and a half from Saint-Pol to Arras.', 'He is going to Arras.”Meanwhile, M. Madeleine had returned home.', 'He had taken the longest wayto return from Master Scaufflaire’s, as though the parsonage door hadbeen a temptation for him, and he had wished to avoid it.', 'He ascendedto his room, and there he shut himself up, which was a very simple act,since he liked to go to bed early.', 'Nevertheless, the portress of thefactory, who was, at the same time, M. Madeleine’s only servant,noticed that the latter’s light was extinguished at half-past eight,and she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home, adding:—“Is Monsieur le Maire ill?', 'I thought he had a rather singular air.”This cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine’schamber.', 'He paid no heed to the portress’s words, but went to bed andto sleep.', 'Towards midnight he woke up with a start; in his sleep he hadheard a noise above his head.', 'He listened; it was a footstep pacingback and forth, as though some one were walking in the room above him.He listened more attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine’s step.', 'Thisstruck him as strange; usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine’schamber until he rose in the morning.', 'A moment later the cashier hearda noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened, and then shutagain; then a piece of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued;then the step began again.', 'The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now,and staring; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of alighted window reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction ofthe rays, it could only come from the window of M. Madeleine’s chamber.The reflection wavered, as though it came rather from a fire which hadbeen lighted than from a candle.', 'The shadow of the window-frame was notshown, which indicated that the window was wide open.', 'The fact thatthis window was open in such cold weather was surprising.', 'The cashierfell asleep again.', 'An hour or two later he waked again.', 'The same stepwas still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead.The reflection was still visible on the wall, but now it was pale andpeaceful, like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle.', 'The window wasstill open.This is what had taken place in M. Madeleine’s room.CHAPTER III—A TEMPEST IN A SKULLThe reader has, no doubt, already divined that M. Madeleine is no otherthan Jean Valjean.We have already gazed into the depths of this conscience; the momenthas now come when we must take another look into it.', 'We do so notwithout emotion and trepidation.', 'There is nothing more terrible inexistence than this sort of contemplation.', 'The eye of the spirit cannowhere find more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man; itcan fix itself on no other thing which is more formidable, morecomplicated, more mysterious, and more infinite.', 'There is a spectaclemore grand than the sea; it is heaven: there is a spectacle more grandthan heaven; it is the inmost recesses of the soul.To make the poem of the human conscience, were it only with referenceto a single man, were it only in connection with the basest of men,would be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic.Conscience is the chaos of chimæras, of lusts, and of temptations; thefurnace of dreams; the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed; it is thepandemonium of sophisms; it is the battlefield of the passions.Penetrate, at certain hours, past the livid face of a human being whois engaged in reflection, and look behind, gaze into that soul, gazeinto that obscurity.', 'There, beneath that external silence, battles ofgiants, like those recorded in Homer, are in progress; skirmishes ofdragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms, as in Milton; visionarycircles, as in Dante.', 'What a solemn thing is this infinity which everyman bears within him, and which he measures with despair against thecaprices of his brain and the actions of his life!Alighieri one day met with a sinister-looking door, before which hehesitated.', 'Here is one before us, upon whose threshold we hesitate.', 'Letus enter, nevertheless.We have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what hadhappened to Jean Valjean after the adventure with Little Gervais.', 'Fromthat moment forth he was, as we have seen, a totally different man.What the Bishop had wished to make of him, that he carried out.', 'It wasmore than a transformation; it was a transfiguration.He succeeded in disappearing, sold the Bishop’s silver, reserving onlythe candlesticks as a souvenir, crept from town to town, traversedFrance, came to M. sur M., conceived the idea which we have mentioned,accomplished what we have related, succeeded in rendering himself safefrom seizure and inaccessible, and, thenceforth, established at M.', 'surM., happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the firsthalf of his existence belied by the last, he lived in peace, reassuredand hopeful, having henceforth only two thoughts,—to conceal his nameand to sanctify his life; to escape men and to return to God.These two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that theyformed but a single one there; both were equally absorbing andimperative and ruled his slightest actions.', 'In general, they conspiredto regulate the conduct of his life; they turned him towards the gloom;they rendered him kindly and simple; they counselled him to the samethings.', 'Sometimes, however, they conflicted.', 'In that case, as thereader will remember, the man whom all the country of M. sur M. calledM.', 'Madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second—hissecurity to his virtue.', 'Thus, in spite of all his reserve and all hisprudence, he had preserved the Bishop’s candlesticks, worn mourning forhim, summoned and interrogated all the little Savoyards who passed thatway, collected information regarding the families at Faverolles, andsaved old Fauchelevent’s life, despite the disquieting insinuations ofJavert.', 'It seemed, as we have already remarked, as though he thought,following the example of all those who have been wise, holy, and just,that his first duty was not towards himself.At the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like this had yetpresented itself.Never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferingswe are narrating, engaged in so serious a struggle.', 'He understood thisconfusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by Javert,when the latter entered his study.', 'At the moment when that name, whichhe had buried beneath so many layers, was so strangely articulated, hewas struck with stupor, and as though intoxicated with the sinistereccentricity of his destiny; and through this stupor he felt thatshudder which precedes great shocks.', 'He bent like an oak at theapproach of a storm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault.', 'Hefelt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon hishead.', 'As he listened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to himwas to go, to run and denounce himself, to take that Champmathieu outof prison and place himself there; this was as painful and as poignantas an incision in the living flesh.', 'Then it passed away, and he said tohimself, “We will see!', 'We will see!” He repressed this first, generousinstinct, and recoiled before heroism.It would be beautiful, no doubt, after the Bishop’s holy words, afterso many years of repentance and abnegation, in the midst of a penitenceadmirably begun, if this man had not flinched for an instant, even inthe presence of so terrible a conjecture, but had continued to walkwith the same step towards this yawning precipice, at the bottom ofwhich lay heaven; that would have been beautiful; but it was not thus.We must render an account of the things which went on in this soul, andwe can only tell what there was there.', 'He was carried away, at first,by the instinct of self-preservation; he rallied all his ideas inhaste, stifled his emotions, took into consideration Javert’s presence,that great danger, postponed all decision with the firmness of terror,shook off thought as to what he had to do, and resumed his calmness asa warrior picks up his buckler.He remained in this state during the rest of the day, a whirlwindwithin, a profound tranquillity without.', 'He took no “preservativemeasures,” as they may be called.', 'Everything was still confused, andjostling together in his brain.', 'His trouble was so great that he couldnot perceive the form of a single idea distinctly, and he could havetold nothing about himself, except that he had received a great blow.He repaired to Fantine’s bed of suffering, as usual, and prolonged hisvisit, through a kindly instinct, telling himself that he must behavethus, and recommend her well to the sisters, in case he should beobliged to be absent himself.', 'He had a vague feeling that he might beobliged to go to Arras; and without having the least in the world madeup his mind to this trip, he said to himself that being, as he was,beyond the shadow of any suspicion, there could be nothing out of theway in being a witness to what was to take place, and he engaged thetilbury from Scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event.He dined with a good deal of appetite.On returning to his room, he communed with himself.He examined the situation, and found it unprecedented; so unprecedentedthat in the midst of his reverie he rose from his chair, moved by someinexplicable impulse of anxiety, and bolted his door.', 'He feared lestsomething more should enter.', 'He was barricading himself againstpossibilities.A moment later he extinguished his light; it embarrassed him.It seemed to him as though he might be seen.By whom?Alas!', 'That on which he desired to close the door had already entered;that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face,—hisconscience.His conscience; that is to say, God.Nevertheless, he deluded himself at first; he had a feeling of securityand of solitude; the bolt once drawn, he thought himself impregnable;the candle extinguished, he felt himself invisible.', 'Then he tookpossession of himself: he set his elbows on the table, leaned his headon his hand, and began to meditate in the dark.“Where do I stand?', 'Am not I dreaming?', 'What have I heard?', 'Is it reallytrue that I have seen that Javert, and that he spoke to me in thatmanner?', 'Who can that Champmathieu be?', 'So he resembles me!', 'Is itpossible?', 'When I reflect that yesterday I was so tranquil, and so farfrom suspecting anything!', 'What was I doing yesterday at this hour?', 'Whatis there in this incident?', 'What will the end be?', 'What is to be done?”This was the torment in which he found himself.', 'His brain had lost itspower of retaining ideas; they passed like waves, and he clutched hisbrow in both hands to arrest them.Nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult whichoverwhelmed his will and his reason, and from which he sought to drawproof and resolution.His head was burning.', 'He went to the window and threw it wide open.There were no stars in the sky.', 'He returned and seated himself at thetable.The first hour passed in this manner.Gradually, however, vague outlines began to take form and to fixthemselves in his meditation, and he was able to catch a glimpse withprecision of the reality,—not the whole situation, but some of thedetails.', 'He began by recognizing the fact that, critical andextraordinary as was this situation, he was completely master of it.This only caused an increase of his stupor.Independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned tohis actions, all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but ahole in which to bury his name.', 'That which he had always feared most ofall in his hours of self-communion, during his sleepless nights, was toever hear that name pronounced; he had said to himself, that that wouldbe the end of all things for him; that on the day when that name madeits reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him,and—who knows?—perhaps even his new soul within him, also.', 'He shudderedat the very thought that this was possible.', 'Assuredly, if any one hadsaid to him at such moments that the hour would come when that namewould ring in his ears, when the hideous words, Jean Valjean, wouldsuddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him, when thatformidable light, capable of dissipating the mystery in which he hadenveloped himself, would suddenly blaze forth above his head, and thatthat name would not menace him, that that light would but produce anobscurity more dense, that this rent veil would but increase themystery, that this earthquake would solidify his edifice, that thisprodigious incident would have no other result, so far as he wasconcerned, if so it seemed good to him, than that of rendering hisexistence at once clearer and more impenetrable, and that, out of hisconfrontation with the phantom of Jean Valjean, the good and worthycitizen Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honored, more peaceful,and more respected than ever—if any one had told him that, he wouldhave tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman.', 'Well,all this was precisely what had just come to pass; all thataccumulation of impossibilities was a fact, and God had permitted thesewild fancies to become real things!His reverie continued to grow clearer.', 'He came more and more to anunderstanding of his position.It seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicabledream, and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in themiddle of the night, erect, shivering, holding back all in vain, on thevery brink of the abyss.', 'He distinctly perceived in the darkness astranger, a man unknown to him, whom destiny had mistaken for him, andwhom she was thrusting into the gulf in his stead; in order that thegulf might close once more, it was necessary that some one, himself orthat other man, should fall into it: he had only let things take theircourse.The light became complete, and he acknowledged this to himself: Thathis place was empty in the galleys; that do what he would, it was stillawaiting him; that the theft from little Gervais had led him back toit; that this vacant place would await him, and draw him on until hefilled it; that this was inevitable and fatal; and then he said tohimself, “that, at this moment, he had a substitute; that it appearedthat a certain Champmathieu had that ill luck, and that, as regardshimself, being present in the galleys in the person of thatChampmathieu, present in society under the name of M. Madeleine, he hadnothing more to fear, provided that he did not prevent men from sealingover the head of that Champmathieu this stone of infamy which, like thestone of the sepulchre, falls once, never to rise again.”All this was so strange and so violent, that there suddenly took placein him that indescribable movement, which no man feels more than two orthree times in the course of his life, a sort of convulsion of theconscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart,which is composed of irony, of joy, and of despair, and which may becalled an outburst of inward laughter.He hastily relighted his candle.“Well, what then?” he said to himself; “what am I afraid of?', 'What isthere in all that for me to think about?', 'I am safe; all is over.', 'I hadbut one partly open door through which my past might invade my life,and behold that door is walled up forever!', 'That Javert, who has beenannoying me so long; that terrible instinct which seemed to havedivined me, which had divined me—good God!', 'and which followed meeverywhere; that frightful hunting-dog, always making a point at me, isthrown off the scent, engaged elsewhere, absolutely turned from thetrail: henceforth he is satisfied; he will leave me in peace; he hashis Jean Valjean.', 'Who knows?', 'it is even probable that he will wish toleave town!', 'And all this has been brought about without any aid fromme, and I count for nothing in it!', 'Ah!', 'but where is the misfortune inthis?', 'Upon my honor, people would think, to see me, that somecatastrophe had happened to me!', 'After all, if it does bring harm tosome one, that is not my fault in the least: it is Providence which hasdone it all; it is because it wishes it so to be, evidently.', 'Have I theright to disarrange what it has arranged?', 'What do I ask now?', 'Why shouldI meddle?', 'It does not concern me; what!', 'I am not satisfied: but whatmore do I want?', 'The goal to which I have aspired for so many years, thedream of my nights, the object of my prayers to Heaven,—security,—Ihave now attained; it is God who wills it; I can do nothing against thewill of God, and why does God will it?', 'In order that I may continuewhat I have begun, that I may do good, that I may one day be a grandand encouraging example, that it may be said at last, that a littlehappiness has been attached to the penance which I have undergone, andto that virtue to which I have returned.', 'Really, I do not understandwhy I was afraid, a little while ago, to enter the house of that goodcuré, and to ask his advice; this is evidently what he would have saidto me: It is settled; let things take their course; let the good God doas he likes!”Thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience,bending over what may be called his own abyss; he rose from his chair,and began to pace the room: “Come,” said he, “let us think no moreabout it; my resolve is taken!” but he felt no joy.Quite the reverse.One can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one canthe sea from returning to the shore: the sailor calls it the tide; theguilty man calls it remorse; God upheaves the soul as he does theocean.After the expiration of a few moments, do what he would, he resumed thegloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened,saying that which he would have preferred to ignore, and listened tothat which he would have preferred not to hear, yielding to thatmysterious power which said to him: “Think!” as it said to anothercondemned man, two thousand years ago, “March on!”Before proceeding further, and in order to make ourselves fullyunderstood, let us insist upon one necessary observation.It is certain that people do talk to themselves; there is no livingbeing who has not done it.', 'It may even be said that the word is never amore magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to consciencewithin a man, and when it returns from conscience to thought; it is inthis sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter, _hesaid, he exclaimed_, must be understood; one speaks to one’s self,talks to one’s self, exclaims to one’s self without breaking theexternal silence; there is a great tumult; everything about us talksexcept the mouth.', 'The realities of the soul are nonetheless realitiesbecause they are not visible and palpable.So he asked himself where he stood.', 'He interrogated himself upon that“settled resolve.” He confessed to himself that all that he had justarranged in his mind was monstrous, that “to let things take theircourse, to let the good God do as he liked,” was simply horrible; toallow this error of fate and of men to be carried out, not to hinderit, to lend himself to it through his silence, to do nothing, in short,was to do everything!', 'that this was hypocritical baseness in the lastdegree!', 'that it was a base, cowardly, sneaking, abject, hideous crime!For the first time in eight years, the wretched man had just tasted thebitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action.He spit it out with disgust.He continued to question himself.', 'He asked himself severely what he hadmeant by this, “My object is attained!” He declared to himself that hislife really had an object; but what object?', 'To conceal his name?', 'Todeceive the police?', 'Was it for so petty a thing that he had done allthat he had done?', 'Had he not another and a grand object, which was thetrue one—to save, not his person, but his soul; to become honest andgood once more; to be a just man?', 'Was it not that above all, thatalone, which he had always desired, which the Bishop had enjoined uponhim—to shut the door on his past?', 'But he was not shutting it!', 'greatGod!', 'he was re-opening it by committing an infamous action!', 'He wasbecoming a thief once more, and the most odious of thieves!', 'He wasrobbing another of his existence, his life, his peace, his place in thesunshine.', 'He was becoming an assassin.', 'He was murdering, morallymurdering, a wretched man.', 'He was inflicting on him that frightfulliving death, that death beneath the open sky, which is called thegalleys.', 'On the other hand, to surrender himself to save that man,struck down with so melancholy an error, to resume his own name, tobecome once more, out of duty, the convict Jean Valjean, that was, intruth, to achieve his resurrection, and to close forever that hellwhence he had just emerged; to fall back there in appearance was toescape from it in reality.', 'This must be done!', 'He had done nothing if hedid not do all this; his whole life was useless; all his penitence waswasted.', 'There was no longer any need of saying, “What is the use?” Hefelt that the Bishop was there, that the Bishop was present all themore because he was dead, that the Bishop was gazing fixedly at him,that henceforth Mayor Madeleine, with all his virtues, would beabominable to him, and that the convict Jean Valjean would be pure andadmirable in his sight; that men beheld his mask, but that the Bishopsaw his face; that men saw his life, but that the Bishop beheld hisconscience.', 'So he must go to Arras, deliver the false Jean Valjean, anddenounce the real one.', 'Alas!', 'that was the greatest of sacrifices, themost poignant of victories, the last step to take; but it must be done.Sad fate!', 'he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of God when hereturned to infamy in the eyes of men.“Well,” said he, “let us decide upon this; let us do our duty; let ussave this man.” He uttered these words aloud, without perceiving thathe was speaking aloud.He took his books, verified them, and put them in order.', 'He flung inthe fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassedtradesmen.', 'He wrote and sealed a letter, and on the envelope it mighthave been read, had there been any one in his chamber at the moment,_To Monsieur Laffitte, Banker, Rue d’Artois, Paris_.', 'He drew from hissecretary a pocket-book which contained several bank-notes and thepassport of which he had made use that same year when he went to theelections.Any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts,into which there entered such grave thought, would have had nosuspicion of what was going on within him.', 'Only occasionally did hislips move; at other times he raised his head and fixed his gaze uponsome point of the wall, as though there existed at that point somethingwhich he wished to elucidate or interrogate.When he had finished the letter to M. Laffitte, he put it into hispocket, together with the pocket-book, and began his walk once more.His reverie had not swerved from its course.', 'He continued to see hisduty clearly, written in luminous letters, which flamed before his eyesand changed its place as he altered the direction of his glance:—_“Go!', 'Tell your name!', 'Denounce yourself!”_In the same way he beheld, as though they had passed before him invisible forms, the two ideas which had, up to that time, formed thedouble rule of his soul,—the concealment of his name, thesanctification of his life.', 'For the first time they appeared to him asabsolutely distinct, and he perceived the distance which separatedthem.', 'He recognized the fact that one of these ideas was, necessarily,good, while the other might become bad; that the first wasself-devotion, and that the other was personality; that the one said,_my neighbour_, and that the other said, _myself_; that one emanatedfrom the light, and the other from darkness.They were antagonistic.', 'He saw them in conflict.', 'In proportion as hemeditated, they grew before the eyes of his spirit.', 'They had nowattained colossal statures, and it seemed to him that he beheld withinhimself, in that infinity of which we were recently speaking, in themidst of the darkness and the lights, a goddess and a giant contending.He was filled with terror; but it seemed to him that the good thoughtwas getting the upper hand.He felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of hisconscience and of his destiny; that the Bishop had marked the firstphase of his new life, and that Champmathieu marked the second.', 'Afterthe grand crisis, the grand test.But the fever, allayed for an instant, gradually resumed possession ofhim.', 'A thousand thoughts traversed his mind, but they continued tofortify him in his resolution.One moment he said to himself that he was, perhaps, taking the mattertoo keenly; that, after all, this Champmathieu was not interesting, andthat he had actually been guilty of theft.He answered himself: “If this man has, indeed, stolen a few apples,that means a month in prison.', 'It is a long way from that to thegalleys.', 'And who knows?', 'Did he steal?', 'Has it been proved?', 'The name ofJean Valjean overwhelms him, and seems to dispense with proofs.', 'Do notthe attorneys for the Crown always proceed in this manner?', 'He issupposed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict.”In another instant the thought had occurred to him that, when hedenounced himself, the heroism of his deed might, perhaps, be takeninto consideration, and his honest life for the last seven years, andwhat he had done for the district, and that they would have mercy onhim.But this supposition vanished very quickly, and he smiled bitterly ashe remembered that the theft of the forty sous from little Gervais puthim in the position of a man guilty of a second offence afterconviction, that this affair would certainly come up, and, according tothe precise terms of the law, would render him liable to penalservitude for life.He turned aside from all illusions, detached himself more and more fromearth, and sought strength and consolation elsewhere.', 'He told himselfthat he must do his duty; that perhaps he should not be more unhappyafter doing his duty than after having avoided it; that if he _allowedthings to take their own course_, if he remained at M. sur M., hisconsideration, his good name, his good works, the deference andveneration paid to him, his charity, his wealth, his popularity, hisvirtue, would be seasoned with a crime.', 'And what would be the taste ofall these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing?', 'while, ifhe accomplished his sacrifice, a celestial idea would be mingled withthe galleys, the post, the iron necklet, the green cap, unceasing toil,and pitiless shame.At length he told himself that it must be so, that his destiny was thusallotted, that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made onhigh, that, in any case, he must make his choice: virtue without andabomination within, or holiness within and infamy without.The stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage tofail, but his brain grow weary.', 'He began to think of other things, ofindifferent matters, in spite of himself.The veins in his temples throbbed violently; he still paced to and fro;midnight sounded first from the parish church, then from the town-hall;he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks, and compared thesounds of the two bells; he recalled in this connection the fact that,a few days previously, he had seen in an ironmonger’s shop an ancientclock for sale, upon which was written the name, _Antoine-Albin deRomainville_.He was cold; he lighted a small fire; it did not occur to him to closethe window.In the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor; he was obliged to makea tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of histhoughts before midnight had struck; he finally succeeded in doingthis.“Ah!', 'yes,” he said to himself, “I had resolved to inform againstmyself.”And then, all of a sudden, he thought of Fantine.“Hold!” said he, “and what about that poor woman?”Here a fresh crisis declared itself.Fantine, by appearing thus abruptly in his reverie, produced the effectof an unexpected ray of light; it seemed to him as though everythingabout him were undergoing a change of aspect: he exclaimed:—“Ah!', 'but I have hitherto considered no one but myself; it is proper forme to hold my tongue or to denounce myself, to conceal my person or tosave my soul, to be a despicable and respected magistrate, or aninfamous and venerable convict; it is I, it is always I and nothing butI: but, good God!', 'all this is egotism; these are diverse forms ofegotism, but it is egotism all the same.', 'What if I were to think alittle about others?', 'The highest holiness is to think of others; come,let us examine the matter.', 'The _I_ excepted, the _I_ effaced, the _I_forgotten, what would be the result of all this?', 'What if I denouncemyself?', 'I am arrested; this Champmathieu is released; I am put back inthe galleys; that is well—and what then?', 'What is going on here?', 'Ah!here is a country, a town, here are factories, an industry, workers,both men and women, aged grandsires, children, poor people!', 'All this Ihave created; all these I provide with their living; everywhere wherethere is a smoking chimney, it is I who have placed the brand on thehearth and meat in the pot; I have created ease, circulation, credit;before me there was nothing; I have elevated, vivified, informed withlife, fecundated, stimulated, enriched the whole country-side; lackingme, the soul is lacking; I take myself off, everything dies: and thiswoman, who has suffered so much, who possesses so many merits in spiteof her fall; the cause of all whose misery I have unwittingly been!', 'Andthat child whom I meant to go in search of, whom I have promised to hermother; do I not also owe something to this woman, in reparation forthe evil which I have done her?', 'If I disappear, what happens?', 'Themother dies; the child becomes what it can; that is what will takeplace, if I denounce myself.', 'If I do not denounce myself?', 'come, let ussee how it will be if I do not denounce myself.”After putting this question to himself, he paused; he seemed to undergoa momentary hesitation and trepidation; but it did not last long, andhe answered himself calmly:—“Well, this man is going to the galleys; it is true, but what thedeuce!', 'he has stolen!', 'There is no use in my saying that he has not beenguilty of theft, for he has!', 'I remain here; I go on: in ten years Ishall have made ten millions; I scatter them over the country; I havenothing of my own; what is that to me?', 'It is not for myself that I amdoing it; the prosperity of all goes on augmenting; industries arearoused and animated; factories and shops are multiplied; families, ahundred families, a thousand families, are happy; the district becomespopulated; villages spring up where there were only farms before; farmsrise where there was nothing; wretchedness disappears, and withwretchedness debauchery, prostitution, theft, murder; all vicesdisappear, all crimes: and this poor mother rears her child; and beholda whole country rich and honest!', 'Ah!', 'I was a fool!', 'I was absurd!', 'whatwas that I was saying about denouncing myself?', 'I really must payattention and not be precipitate about anything.', 'What!', 'because it wouldhave pleased me to play the grand and generous; this is melodrama,after all; because I should have thought of no one but myself, theidea!', 'for the sake of saving from a punishment, a trifle exaggerated,perhaps, but just at bottom, no one knows whom, a thief, agood-for-nothing, evidently, a whole country-side must perish!', 'a poorwoman must die in the hospital!', 'a poor little girl must die in thestreet!', 'like dogs; ah, this is abominable!', 'And without the mother evenhaving seen her child once more, almost without the child’s havingknown her mother; and all that for the sake of an old wretch of anapple-thief who, most assuredly, has deserved the galleys for somethingelse, if not for that; fine scruples, indeed, which save a guilty manand sacrifice the innocent, which save an old vagabond who has only afew years to live at most, and who will not be more unhappy in thegalleys than in his hovel, and which sacrifice a whole population,mothers, wives, children.', 'This poor little Cosette who has no one inthe world but me, and who is, no doubt, blue with cold at this momentin the den of those Thénardiers; those peoples are rascals; and I wasgoing to neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures; and I wasgoing off to denounce myself; and I was about to commit thatunspeakable folly!', 'Let us put it at the worst: suppose that there is awrong action on my part in this, and that my conscience will reproachme for it some day, to accept, for the good of others, these reproacheswhich weigh only on myself; this evil action which compromises my soulalone; in that lies self-sacrifice; in that alone there is virtue.”He rose and resumed his march; this time, he seemed to be content.Diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth; truths arefound only in the depths of thought.', 'It seemed to him, that, afterhaving descended into these depths, after having long groped among thedarkest of these shadows, he had at last found one of these diamonds,one of these truths, and that he now held it in his hand, and he wasdazzled as he gazed upon it.“Yes,” he thought, “this is right; I am on the right road; I have thesolution; I must end by holding fast to something; my resolve is taken;let things take their course; let us no longer vacillate; let us nolonger hang back; this is for the interest of all, not for my own; I amMadeleine, and Madeleine I remain.', 'Woe to the man who is Jean Valjean!I am no longer he; I do not know that man; I no longer know anything;it turns out that some one is Jean Valjean at the present moment; lethim look out for himself; that does not concern me; it is a fatal namewhich was floating abroad in the night; if it halts and descends on ahead, so much the worse for that head.”He looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney-piece,and said:—“Hold!', 'it has relieved me to come to a decision; I am quite another mannow.”He proceeded a few paces further, then he stopped short.“Come!” he said, “I must not flinch before any of the consequences ofthe resolution which I have once adopted; there are still threads whichattach me to that Jean Valjean; they must be broken; in this very roomthere are objects which would betray me, dumb things which would bearwitness against me; it is settled; all these things must disappear.”He fumbled in his pocket, drew out his purse, opened it, and took out asmall key; he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly beseen, so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design whichcovered the wall-paper; a secret receptacle opened, a sort of falsecupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and thechimney-piece; in this hiding-place there were some rags—a blue linenblouse, an old pair of trousers, an old knapsack, and a huge thorncudgel shod with iron at both ends.', 'Those who had seen Jean Valjean atthe epoch when he passed through D—— in October, 1815, could easilyhave recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit.He had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks, inorder to remind himself continually of his starting-point, but he hadconcealed all that came from the galleys, and he had allowed thecandlesticks which came from the Bishop to be seen.He cast a furtive glance towards the door, as though he feared that itwould open in spite of the bolt which fastened it; then, with a quickand abrupt movement, he took the whole in his arms at once, withoutbestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiouslyand so perilously preserved for so many years, and flung them all,rags, cudgel, knapsack, into the fire.', 'EnlargeCandlesticks Into the Fire  1b7-3-into-the-fireHe closed the false cupboard again, and with redoubled precautions,henceforth unnecessary, since it was now empty, he concealed the doorbehind a heavy piece of furniture, which he pushed in front of it.After the lapse of a few seconds, the room and the opposite wall werelighted up with a fierce, red, tremulous glow.', 'Everything was on fire;the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of thechamber.As the knapsack was consumed, together with the hideous rags which itcontained, it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes.', 'Bybending over, one could have readily recognized a coin,—no doubt theforty-sou piece stolen from the little Savoyard.He did not look at the fire, but paced back and forth with the samestep.All at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks, which shonevaguely on the chimney-piece, through the glow.“Hold!” he thought; “the whole of Jean Valjean is still in them.', 'Theymust be destroyed also.”He seized the two candlesticks.There was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape,and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal.He bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment.', 'He felt asense of real comfort.', '“How good warmth is!” said he.He stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks.A minute more, and they were both in the fire.At that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within himshouting: “Jean Valjean!', 'Jean Valjean!”His hair rose upright: he became like a man who is listening to someterrible thing.“Yes, that’s it!', 'finish!” said the voice.', '“Complete what you are about!Destroy these candlesticks!', 'Annihilate this souvenir!', 'Forget theBishop!', 'Forget everything!', 'Destroy this Champmathieu, do!', 'That isright!', 'Applaud yourself!', 'So it is settled, resolved, fixed, agreed:here is an old man who does not know what is wanted of him, who has,perhaps, done nothing, an innocent man, whose whole misfortune lies inyour name, upon whom your name weighs like a crime, who is about to betaken for you, who will be condemned, who will finish his days inabjectness and horror.', 'That is good!', 'Be an honest man yourself; remainMonsieur le Maire; remain honorable and honored; enrich the town;nourish the indigent; rear the orphan; live happy, virtuous, andadmired; and, during this time, while you are here in the midst of joyand light, there will be a man who will wear your red blouse, who willbear your name in ignominy, and who will drag your chain in thegalleys.', 'Yes, it is well arranged thus.', 'Ah, wretch!”The perspiration streamed from his brow.', 'He fixed a haggard eye on thecandlesticks.', 'But that within him which had spoken had not finished.The voice continued:—“Jean Valjean, there will be around you many voices, which will make agreat noise, which will talk very loud, and which will bless you, andonly one which no one will hear, and which will curse you in the dark.Well!', 'listen, infamous man!', 'All those benedictions will fall backbefore they reach heaven, and only the malediction will ascend to God.”This voice, feeble at first, and which had proceeded from the mostobscure depths of his conscience, had gradually become startling andformidable, and he now heard it in his very ear.', 'It seemed to him thatit had detached itself from him, and that it was now speaking outsideof him.', 'He thought that he heard the last words so distinctly, that heglanced around the room in a sort of terror.“Is there any one here?” he demanded aloud, in utter bewilderment.Then he resumed, with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot:—“How stupid I am!', 'There can be no one!”There was some one; but the person who was there was of those whom thehuman eye cannot see.He placed the candlesticks on the chimney-piece.Then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp, which troubled thedreams of the sleeping man beneath him, and awoke him with a start.This tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him.It sometimes seems, on supreme occasions, as though people moved aboutfor the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounterby change of place.', 'After the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knewhis position.He now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which hehad arrived in turn.', 'The two ideas which counselled him appeared to himequally fatal.', 'What a fatality!', 'What conjunction that that Champmathieushould have been taken for him;

a vast, gloomy plain, where there was no grass.', 'Itdid not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night.“I was walking with my brother, the brother of my childish years, thebrother of whom, I must say, I never think, and whom I now hardlyremember.“We were conversing and we met some passers-by.', 'We were talking of aneighbor of ours in former days, who had always worked with her windowopen from the time when she came to live on the street.', 'As we talked wefelt cold because of that open window.“There were no trees in the plain.', 'We saw a man passing close to us.', 'Hewas entirely nude, of the hue of ashes, and mounted on a horse whichwas earth color.', 'The man had no hair;

a second sound similar to the first rousedhim thoroughly; he looked and recognized the fact that these two starswere the lanterns of a carriage.', 'By the light which they cast he wasable to distinguish the form of this vehicle.', 'It was a tilburyharnessed to a small white horse.', 'The noise which he had heard was thetrampling of the horse’s hoofs on the pavement.“What vehicle is this?” he said to himself.', '“Who is coming here soearly in the morning?”At that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber.He shuddered from head to foot, and cried in a terrible voice:—“Who is there?”Some one said:—“I, Monsieur le Maire.”He recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress.“Well!” he replied, “what is it?”“Monsieur le Maire, it is just five o’clock in the morning.”“What is that to me?”“The cabriolet is here, Monsieur le Maire.”“What cabriolet?”“The tilbury.”“What tilbury?”“Did not Monsieur le Maire order a tilbury?”“No,” said he.“The coachman says that he has come for Monsieur le Maire.”“What coachman?”“M.', 'Scaufflaire’s coachman.”“M.', 'Scaufflaire?”That name sent a shudder over him, as though a flash of lightning hadpassed in front of his face.“Ah!', 'yes,” he resumed; “M.', 'Scaufflaire!”If the old woman could have seen him at that moment, she would havebeen frightened.A tolerably long silence ensued.', 'He examined the flame of the candlewith a stupid air, and from around the wick he took some of the burningwax, which he rolled between his fingers.', 'The old woman waited for him.She even ventured to uplift her voice once more:—“What am I to say, Monsieur le Maire?”“Say that it is well, and that I am coming down.”CHAPTER V—HINDRANCESThe posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated at thisperiod by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire.', 'Thesemail-wagons were two-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered inside withfawn-colored leather, hung on springs, and having but two seats, onefor the postboy, the other for the traveller.', 'The wheels were armedwith those long, offensive axles which keep other vehicles at adistance, and which may still be seen on the road in Germany.', 'Thedespatch box, an immense oblong coffer, was placed behind the vehicleand formed a part of it.', 'This coffer was painted black, and thecabriolet yellow.These vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had somethingdistorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing inthe distance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they resembledthe insects which are called, I think, termites, and which, though withbut little corselet, drag a great train behind them.', 'But they travelledat a very rapid rate.', 'The post-wagon which set out from Arras at oneo’clock every night, after the mail from Paris had passed, arrived atM.', 'sur M. a little before five o’clock in the morning.That night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdinroad, collided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering thetown, with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, which was goingin the opposite direction, and in which there was but one person, a manenveloped in a mantle.', 'The wheel of the tilbury received quite aviolent shock.', 'The postman shouted to the man to stop, but thetraveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop.“That man is in a devilish hurry!” said the postman.The man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen strugglingin convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity.Whither was he going?', 'He could not have told.', 'Why was he hastening?', 'Hedid not know.', 'He was driving at random, straight ahead.', 'Whither?', 'ToArras, no doubt; but he might have been going elsewhere as well.', 'Attimes he was conscious of it, and he shuddered.', 'He plunged into thenight as into a gulf.', 'Something urged him forward; something drew himon.', 'No one could have told what was taking place within him; every onewill understand it.', 'What man is there who has not entered, at leastonce in his life, into that obscure cavern of the unknown?However, he had resolved on nothing, decided nothing, formed no plan,done nothing.', 'None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive.He was, more than ever, as he had been at the first moment.Why was he going to Arras?He repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hiredScaufflaire’s cabriolet: that, whatever the result was to be, there wasno reason why he should not see with his own eyes, and judge of mattersfor himself; that this was even prudent; that he must know what tookplace; that no decision could be arrived at without having observed andscrutinized; that one made mountains out of everything from a distance;that, at any rate, when he should have seen that Champmathieu, somewretch, his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow himto go to the galleys in his stead; that Javert would indeed be there;and that Brevet, that Chenildieu, that Cochepaille, old convicts whohad known him; but they certainly would not recognize him;—bah!', 'what anidea!', 'that Javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth; thatall conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on Champmathieu, andthat there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures;that accordingly there was no danger.That it was, no doubt, a dark moment, but that he should emerge fromit; that, after all, he held his destiny, however bad it might be, inhis own hand; that he was master of it.', 'He clung to this thought.At bottom, to tell the whole truth, he would have preferred not to goto Arras.Nevertheless, he was going thither.As he meditated, he whipped up his horse, which was proceeding at thatfine, regular, and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a halfan hour.In proportion as the cabriolet advanced, he felt something within himdraw back.At daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur M. lay farbehind him.', 'He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all thechilly figures of a winter’s dawn as they passed before his eyes, butwithout seeing them.', 'The morning has its spectres as well as theevening.', 'He did not see them; but without his being aware of it, and bymeans of a sort of penetration which was almost physical, these blacksilhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinisterquality to the violent state of his soul.Each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings whichsometimes border on the highway, he said to himself, “And yet there arepeople there within who are sleeping!”The trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels on theroad, produced a gentle, monotonous noise.', 'These things are charmingwhen one is joyous, and lugubrious when one is sad.It was broad daylight when he arrived at Hesdin.', 'He halted in front ofthe inn, to allow the horse a breathing spell, and to have him givensome oats.The horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small race of theBoulonnais, which has too much head, too much belly, and not enoughneck and shoulders, but which has a broad chest, a large crupper, thin,fine legs, and solid hoofs—a homely, but a robust and healthy race.', 'Theexcellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours, and had not adrop of sweat on his loins.He did not get out of the tilbury.', 'The stableman who brought the oatssuddenly bent down and examined the left wheel.“Are you going far in this condition?” said the man.He replied, with an air of not having roused himself from his reverie:—“Why?”“Have you come from a great distance?” went on the man.“Five leagues.”“Ah!”“Why do you say, ‘Ah?’”The man bent down once more, was silent for a moment, with his eyesfixed on the wheel; then he rose erect and said:—“Because, though this wheel has travelled five leagues, it certainlywill not travel another quarter of a league.”He sprang out of the tilbury.“What is that you say, my friend?”“I say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagueswithout you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway.', 'Justsee here!”The wheel really had suffered serious damage.', 'The shock administered bythe mail-wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub, so that thenut no longer held firm.“My friend,” he said to the stableman, “is there a wheelwright here?”“Certainly, sir.”“Do me the service to go and fetch him.”“He is only a step from here.', 'Hey!', 'Master Bourgaillard!”Master Bourgaillard, the wheelwright, was standing on his ownthreshold.', 'He came, examined the wheel and made a grimace like asurgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken.“Can you repair this wheel immediately?”“Yes, sir.”“When can I set out again?”“To-morrow.”“To-morrow!”“There is a long day’s work on it.', 'Are you in a hurry, sir?”“In a very great hurry.', 'I must set out again in an hour at the latest.”“Impossible, sir.”“I will pay whatever you ask.”“Impossible.”“Well, in two hours, then.”“Impossible to-day.', 'Two new spokes and a hub must be made.', 'Monsieurwill not be able to start before to-morrow morning.”“The matter cannot wait until to-morrow.', 'What if you were to replacethis wheel instead of repairing it?”“How so?”“You are a wheelwright?”“Certainly, sir.”“Have you not a wheel that you can sell me?', 'Then I could start again atonce.”“A spare wheel?”“Yes.”“I have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet.', 'Two wheels makea pair.', 'Two wheels cannot be put together hap-hazard.”“In that case, sell me a pair of wheels.”“Not all wheels fit all axles, sir.”“Try, nevertheless.”“It is useless, sir.', 'I have nothing to sell but cart-wheels.', 'We are buta poor country here.”“Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?”The wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was ahired vehicle.', 'He shrugged his shoulders.“You treat the cabriolets that people let you so well!', 'If I had one, Iwould not let it to you!”“Well, sell it to me, then.”“I have none.”“What!', 'not even a spring-cart?', 'I am not hard to please, as you see.”“We live in a poor country.', 'There is, in truth,” added the wheelwright,“an old calash under the shed yonder, which belongs to a bourgeois ofthe town, who gave it to me to take care of, and who only uses it onthe thirty-sixth of the month—never, that is to say.', 'I might let thatto you, for what matters it to me?', 'But the bourgeois must not see itpass—and then, it is a calash; it would require two horses.”“I will take two post-horses.”“Where is Monsieur going?”“To Arras.”“And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day?”“Yes, of course.”“By taking two post-horses?”“Why not?”“Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four o’clockto-morrow morning?”“Certainly not.”“There is one thing to be said about that, you see, by takingpost-horses—Monsieur has his passport?”“Yes.”“Well, by taking post-horses, Monsieur cannot reach Arras beforeto-morrow.', 'We are on a crossroad.', 'The relays are badly served, thehorses are in the fields.', 'The season for ploughing is just beginning;heavy teams are required, and horses are seized upon everywhere, fromthe post as well as elsewhere.', 'Monsieur will have to wait three or fourhours at the least at every relay.', 'And, then, they drive at a walk.There are many hills to ascend.”“Come then, I will go on horseback.', 'Unharness the cabriolet.', 'Some onecan surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood.”“Without doubt.', 'But will this horse bear the saddle?”“That is true; you remind me of that; he will not bear it.”“Then—”“But I can surely hire a horse in the village?”“A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch?”“Yes.”“That would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts.', 'Youwould have to buy it to begin with, because no one knows you.', 'But youwill not find one for sale nor to let, for five hundred francs, or fora thousand.”“What am I to do?”“The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man, andset out on your journey to-morrow.”“To-morrow will be too late.”“The deuce!”“Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras?', 'When will it pass?”“To-night.', 'Both the posts pass at night; the one going as well as theone coming.”“What!', 'It will take you a day to mend this wheel?”“A day, and a good long one.”“If you set two men to work?”“If I set ten men to work.”“What if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes?”“That could be done with the spokes, not with the hub; and the felly isin a bad state, too.”“Is there any one in this village who lets out teams?”“No.”“Is there another wheelwright?”The stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert, with a toss ofthe head.“No.”He felt an immense joy.It was evident that Providence was intervening.', 'That it was it who hadbroken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road.He had not yielded to this sort of first summons; he had just madeevery possible effort to continue the journey; he had loyally andscrupulously exhausted all means; he had been deterred neither by theseason, nor fatigue, nor by the expense; he had nothing with which toreproach himself.', 'If he went no further, that was no fault of his.', 'Itdid not concern him further.', 'It was no longer his fault.', 'It was not theact of his own conscience, but the act of Providence.He breathed again.', 'He breathed freely and to the full extent of hislungs for the first time since Javert’s visit.', 'It seemed to him thatthe hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the lasttwenty hours had just released him.It seemed to him that God was for him now, and was manifesting Himself.He said to himself that he had done all he could, and that now he hadnothing to do but retrace his steps quietly.If his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamberof the inn, it would have had no witnesses, no one would have heardhim, things would have rested there, and it is probable that we shouldnot have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is aboutto peruse; but this conversation had taken place in the street.', 'Anycolloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd.', 'There are alwayspeople who ask nothing better than to become spectators.', 'While he wasquestioning the wheelwright, some people who were passing back andforth halted around them.', 'After listening for a few minutes, a younglad, to whom no one had paid any heed, detached himself from the groupand ran off.At the moment when the traveller, after the inward deliberation whichwe have just described, resolved to retrace his steps, this childreturned.', 'He was accompanied by an old woman.“Monsieur,” said the woman, “my boy tells me that you wish to hire acabriolet.”These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made theperspiration trickle down his limbs.', 'He thought that he beheld the handwhich had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him, readyto seize him once more.He answered:—“Yes, my good woman; I am in search of a cabriolet which I can hire.”And he hastened to add:—“But there is none in the place.”“Certainly there is,” said the old woman.“Where?” interpolated the wheelwright.“At my house,” replied the old woman.He shuddered.', 'The fatal hand had grasped him again.The old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart.', 'Thewheelwright and the stable-man, in despair at the prospect of thetraveller escaping their clutches, interfered.“It was a frightful old trap; it rests flat on the axle; it is anactual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs;the rain came into it; the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture;it would not go much further than the tilbury; a regular ramshackle oldstage-wagon; the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trustedhimself to it,” etc., etc.All this was true; but this trap, this ramshackle old vehicle, thisthing, whatever it was, ran on its two wheels and could go to Arras.He paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright to berepaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, had the white horseput to the cart, climbed into it, and resumed the road which he hadbeen travelling since morning.At the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he had felt, amoment previously, a certain joy in the thought that he should not gowhither he was now proceeding.', 'He examined this joy with a sort ofwrath, and found it absurd.', 'Why should he feel joy at turning back?After all, he was taking this trip of his own free will.', 'No one wasforcing him to it.And assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose.As he left Hesdin, he heard a voice shouting to him: “Stop!', 'Stop!” Hehalted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish andconvulsive element resembling hope.It was the old woman’s little boy.“Monsieur,” said the latter, “it was I who got the cart for you.”“Well?”“You have not given me anything.”He who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almostodious.“Ah!', 'it’s you, you scamp?” said he; “you shall have nothing.”He whipped up his horse and set off at full speed.He had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin.', 'He wanted to make it good.The little horse was courageous, and pulled for two; but it was themonth of February, there had been rain; the roads were bad.', 'And then,it was no longer the tilbury.', 'The cart was very heavy, and in addition,there were many ascents.He took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol; four hoursfor five leagues.At Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came toand led to the stable; as he had promised Scaufflaire, he stood besidethe manger while the horse was eating; he thought of sad and confusingthings.The inn-keeper’s wife came to the stable.“Does not Monsieur wish to breakfast?”“Come, that is true; I even have a good appetite.”He followed the woman, who had a rosy, cheerful face; she led him tothe public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth.“Make haste!” said he; “I must start again; I am in a hurry.”A big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all haste; helooked at the girl with a sensation of comfort.“That is what ailed me,” he thought; “I had not breakfasted.”His breakfast was served; he seized the bread, took a mouthful, andthen slowly replaced it on the table, and did not touch it again.A carter was eating at another table; he said to this man:—“Why is their bread so bitter here?”The carter was a German and did not understand him.He returned to the stable and remained near the horse.An hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his coursetowards Tinques, which is only five leagues from Arras.What did he do during this journey?', 'Of what was he thinking?', 'As in themorning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fieldspass by, and the way in which the landscape, broken at every turn ofthe road, vanished; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimessuffices to the soul, and almost relieves it from thought.', 'What is moremelancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for thefirst and the last time?', 'To travel is to be born and to die at everyinstant; perhaps, in the vaguest region of his mind, he did makecomparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence: allthe things of life are perpetually fleeing before us; the dark andbright intervals are intermingled; after a dazzling moment, an eclipse;we look, we hasten, we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing;each event is a turn in the road, and, all at once, we are old; we feela shock; all is black; we distinguish an obscure door; the gloomy horseof life, which has been drawing us halts, and we see a veiled andunknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of schoolbeheld this traveller enter Tinques; it is true that the days werestill short; he did not halt at Tinques; as he emerged from thevillage, a laborer, who was mending the road with stones, raised hishead and said to him:—“That horse is very much fatigued.”The poor beast was, in fact, going at a walk.“Are you going to Arras?” added the road-mender.“Yes.”“If you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early.”He stopped his horse, and asked the laborer:—“How far is it from here to Arras?”“Nearly seven good leagues.”“How is that?', 'the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter.”“Ah!” returned the road-mender, “so you don’t know that the road isunder repair?', 'You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on;there is no way to proceed further.”“Really?”“You will take the road on the left, leading to Carency; you will crossthe river; when you reach Camblin, you will turn to the right; that isthe road to Mont-Saint-Éloy which leads to Arras.”“But it is night, and I shall lose my way.”“You do not belong in these parts?”“No.”“And, besides, it is all crossroads; stop!', 'sir,” resumed theroad-mender; “shall I give you a piece of advice?', 'your horse is tired;return to Tinques; there is a good inn there; sleep there; you canreach Arras to-morrow.”“I must be there this evening.”“That is different; but go to the inn all the same, and get an extrahorse; the stable-boy will guide you through the crossroads.”He followed the road-mender’s advice, retraced his steps, and, half anhour later, he passed the same spot again, but this time at full speed,with a good horse to aid; a stable-boy, who called himself a postilion,was seated on the shaft of the cariole.Still, he felt that he had lost time.Night had fully come.They turned into the crossroad; the way became frightfully bad; thecart lurched from one rut to the other; he said to the postilion:—“Keep at a trot, and you shall have a double fee.”In one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke.“There’s the whiffle-tree broken, sir,” said the postilion; “I don’tknow how to harness my horse now; this road is very bad at night; ifyou wish to return and sleep at Tinques, we could be in Arras earlyto-morrow morning.”He replied, “Have you a bit of rope and a knife?”“Yes, sir.”He cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle-tree of it.This caused another loss of twenty minutes; but they set out again at agallop.The plain was gloomy; low-hanging, black, crisp fogs crept over thehills and wrenched themselves away like smoke: there were whitishgleams in the clouds; a strong breeze which blew in from the seaproduced a sound in all quarters of the horizon, as of some one movingfurniture; everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror.How many things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night!He was stiff with cold; he had eaten nothing since the night before; hevaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in theneighborhood of D——, eight years previously, and it seemed butyesterday.The hour struck from a distant tower; he asked the boy:—“What time is it?”“Seven o’clock, sir; we shall reach Arras at eight; we have but threeleagues still to go.”At that moment, he for the first time indulged in this reflection,thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner: thatall this trouble which he was taking was, perhaps, useless; that he didnot know so much as the hour of the trial; that he should, at least,have informed himself of that; that he was foolish to go thus straightahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not; thenhe sketched out some calculations in his mind: that, ordinarily, thesittings of the Court of Assizes began at nine o’clock in the morning;that it could not be a long affair; that the theft of the apples wouldbe very brief; that there would then remain only a question ofidentity, four or five depositions, and very little for the lawyers tosay; that he should arrive after all was over.The postilion whipped up the horses; they had crossed the river andleft Mont-Saint-Éloy behind them.The night grew more profound.CHAPTER VI—SISTER SIMPLICE PUT TO THE PROOFBut at that moment Fantine was joyous.She had passed a very bad night; her cough was frightful; her fever haddoubled in intensity; she had had dreams: in the morning, when thedoctor paid his visit, she was delirious; he assumed an alarmed look,and ordered that he should be informed as soon as M. Madeleine arrived.All the morning she was melancholy, said but little, and laid plaits inher sheets, murmuring the while, in a low voice, calculations whichseemed to be calculations of distances.', 'Her eyes were hollow andstaring.', 'They seemed almost extinguished at intervals, then lighted upagain and shone like stars.', 'It seems as though, at the approach of acertain dark hour, the light of heaven fills those who are quitting thelight of earth.Each time that Sister Simplice asked her how she felt, she repliedinvariably, “Well.', 'I should like to see M.

Madeleine’s delay.In the meantime, Fantine was staring at the tester of her bed.', 'Sheseemed to be endeavoring to recall something.', 'All at once she began tosing in a voice as feeble as a breath.', 'The nun listened.', 'This is whatFantine was singing:—“Lovely things we will buyAs we stroll the faubourgs through.Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,I love my love, corn-flowers are blue.“Yestere’en the Virgin Mary came near my stove, in a broidered mantleclad, and said to me, ‘Here, hide ‘neath my veil the child whom you oneday begged from me.', 'Haste to the city, buy linen, buy a needle, buythread.’“Lovely things we will buyAs we stroll the faubourgs through.“Dear Holy Virgin, beside my stove I have set a cradle with ribbonsdecked.', 'God may give me his loveliest star; I prefer the child thouhast granted me.', '‘Madame, what shall I do with this linen fine?’—‘Makeof it clothes for thy new-born babe.’“Roses are pink and corn-flowers are blue,I love my love, and corn-flowers are blue.“‘Wash this linen.’—‘Where?’—‘In the stream.', 'Make of it, soiling not,spoiling not, a petticoat fair with its bodice fine, which I willembroider and fill with flowers.’—‘Madame, the child is no longer here;what is to be done?’—‘Then make of it a winding-sheet in which to buryme.’“Lovely things we will buyAs we stroll the faubourgs through,Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,I love my love, corn-flowers are blue.”This song was an old cradle romance with which she had, in former days,lulled her little Cosette to sleep, and which had never recurred to hermind in all the five years during which she had been parted from herchild.', 'She sang it in so sad a voice, and to so sweet an air, that itwas enough to make any one, even a nun, weep.', 'The sister, accustomed asshe was to austerities, felt a tear spring to her eyes.The clock struck six.', 'Fantine did not seem to hear it.', 'She no longerseemed to pay attention to anything about her.Sister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of thefactory, whether the mayor had returned, and if he would not come tothe infirmary soon.', 'The girl returned in a few minutes.Fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts.The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that the mayorhad set out that morning before six o’clock, in a little tilburyharnessed to a white horse, cold as the weather was; that he had gonealone, without even a driver; that no one knew what road he had taken;that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to Arras; thatothers asserted that they had met him on the road to Paris.', 'That whenhe went away he had been very gentle, as usual, and that he had merelytold the portress not to expect him that night.While the two women were whispering together, with their backs turnedto Fantine’s bed, the sister interrogating, the servant conjecturing,Fantine, with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies, whichunite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation ofdeath, had raised herself to her knees in bed, with her shrivelledhands resting on the bolster, and her head thrust through the openingof the curtains, and was listening.', 'All at once she cried:—“You are speaking of M. Madeleine!', 'Why are you talking so low?', 'What ishe doing?', 'Why does he not come?”Her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought theyheard the voice of a man; they wheeled round in affright.“Answer me!” cried Fantine.The servant stammered:—“The portress told me that he could not come to-day.”“Be calm, my child,” said the sister; “lie down again.”Fantine, without changing her attitude, continued in a loud voice, andwith an accent that was both imperious and heart-rending:—“He cannot come?', 'Why not?', 'You know the reason.', 'You are whispering it toeach other there.', 'I want to know it.”The servant-maid hastened to say in the nun’s ear, “Say that he is busywith the city council.”Sister Simplice blushed faintly, for it was a lie that the maid hadproposed to her.On the other hand, it seemed to her that the mere communication of thetruth to the invalid would, without doubt, deal her a terrible blow,and that this was a serious matter in Fantine’s present state.', 'Herflush did not last long; the sister raised her calm, sad eyes toFantine, and said, “Monsieur le Maire has gone away.”Fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed: her eyessparkled; indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face.“Gone!” she cried; “he has gone to get Cosette.”Then she raised her arms to heaven, and her white face becameineffable; her lips moved; she was praying in a low voice.When her prayer was finished, “Sister,” she said, “I am willing to liedown again; I will do anything you wish; I was naughty just now; I begyour pardon for having spoken so loud; it is very wrong to talk loudly;I know that well, my good sister, but, you see, I am very happy: thegood God is good; M. Madeleine is good; just think!', 'he has gone toMontfermeil to get my little Cosette.”She lay down again, with the nun’s assistance, helped the nun toarrange her pillow, and kissed the little silver cross which she woreon her neck, and which Sister Simplice had given her.“My child,” said the sister, “try to rest now, and do not talk anymore.”Fantine took the sister’s hand in her moist hands, and the latter waspained to feel that perspiration.“He set out this morning for Paris; in fact, he need not even gothrough Paris; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence.Do you remember how he said to me yesterday, when I spoke to him ofCosette, _Soon, soon?_ He wants to give me a surprise, you know!', 'hemade me sign a letter so that she could be taken from the Thénardiers;they cannot say anything, can they?', 'they will give back Cosette, forthey have been paid; the authorities will not allow them to keep thechild since they have received their pay.', 'Do not make signs to me thatI must not talk, sister!', 'I am extremely happy; I am doing well; I amnot ill at all any more; I am going to see Cosette again; I am evenquite hungry; it is nearly five years since I saw her last; you cannotimagine how much attached one gets to children, and then, she will beso pretty; you will see!', 'If you only knew what pretty little rosyfingers she had!', 'In the first place, she will have very beautifulhands; she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old; likethis!', 'she must be a big girl now; she is seven years old; she is quitea young lady; I call her Cosette, but her name is really Euphrasie.Stop!', 'this morning I was looking at the dust on the chimney-piece, andI had a sort of idea come across me, like that, that I should seeCosette again soon.', 'Mon Dieu!', 'how wrong it is not to see one’s childrenfor years!', 'One ought to reflect that life is not eternal.', 'Oh, how goodM.', 'le Maire is to go!', 'it is very cold!', 'it is true; he had on his cloak,at least?', 'he will be here to-morrow, will he not?', 'to-morrow will be afestival day; to-morrow morning, sister, you must remind me to put onmy little cap that has lace on it.', 'What a place that Montfermeil is!', 'Itook that journey on foot once; it was very long for me, but thediligences go very quickly!', 'he will be here to-morrow with Cosette: howfar is it from here to Montfermeil?”The sister, who had no idea of distances, replied, “Oh, I think that hewill be here to-morrow.”“To-morrow!', 'to-morrow!” said Fantine, “I shall see Cosette to-morrow!you see, good sister of the good God, that I am no longer ill; I ammad; I could dance if any one wished it.”A person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would nothave understood the change; she was all rosy now; she spoke in a livelyand natural voice; her whole face was one smile; now and then shetalked, she laughed softly; the joy of a mother is almost infantile.“Well,” resumed the nun, “now that you are happy, mind me, and do nottalk any more.”Fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice: “Yes, liedown again; be good, for you are going to have your child; SisterSimplice is right; every one here is right.”And then, without stirring, without even moving her head, she began tostare all about her with wide-open eyes and a joyous air, and she saidnothing more.The sister drew the curtains together again, hoping that she would fallinto a doze.', 'Between seven and eight o’clock the doctor came; nothearing any sound, he thought Fantine was asleep, entered softly, andapproached the bed on tiptoe; he opened the curtains a little, and, bythe light of the taper, he saw Fantine’s big eyes gazing at him.She said to him, “She will be allowed to sleep beside me in a littlebed, will she not, sir?”The doctor thought that she was delirious.', 'She added:—“See!', 'there is just room.”The doctor took Sister Simplice aside, and she explained matters tohim; that M. Madeleine was absent for a day or two, and that in theirdoubt they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid, whobelieved that the mayor had gone to Montfermeil; that it was possible,after all, that her guess was correct: the doctor approved.He returned to Fantine’s bed, and she went on:—“You see, when she wakes up in the morning, I shall be able to say goodmorning to her, poor kitten, and when I cannot sleep at night, I canhear her asleep; her little gentle breathing will do me good.”“Give me your hand,” said the doctor.She stretched out her arm, and exclaimed with a laugh:—“Ah, hold!', 'in truth, you did not know it; I am cured; Cosette willarrive to-morrow.”The doctor was surprised; she was better; the pressure on her chest haddecreased; her pulse had regained its strength; a sort of life hadsuddenly supervened and reanimated this poor, worn-out creature.“Doctor,” she went on, “did the sister tell you that M. le Maire hasgone to get that mite of a child?”The doctor recommended silence, and that all painful emotions should beavoided; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona, and, in case thefever should increase again during the night, a calming potion.', 'As hetook his departure, he said to the sister:—“She is doing better; if good luck willed that the mayor shouldactually arrive to-morrow with the child, who knows?', 'there are crisesso astounding; great joy has been known to arrest maladies; I know wellthat this is an organic disease, and in an advanced state, but allthose things are such mysteries: we may be able to save her.”CHAPTER VII—THE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAKES PRECAUTIONS FORDEPARTUREIt was nearly eight o’clock in the evening when the cart, which we lefton the road, entered the porte-cochère of the Hotel de la Poste inArras; the man whom we have been following up to this moment alightedfrom it, responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of thepeople of the inn, sent back the extra horse, and with his own handsled the little white horse to the stable; then he opened the door of abilliard-room which was situated on the ground floor, sat down there,and leaned his elbows on a table; he had taken fourteen hours for thejourney which he had counted on making in six; he did himself thejustice to acknowledge that it was not his fault, but at bottom, he wasnot sorry.The landlady of the hotel entered.“Does Monsieur wish a bed?', 'Does Monsieur require supper?”He made a sign of the head in the negative.“The stableman says that Monsieur’s horse is extremely fatigued.”Here he broke his silence.“Will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to-morrowmorning?”“Oh, Monsieur!', 'he must rest for two days at least.”He inquired:—“Is not the posting-station located here?”“Yes, sir.”The hostess conducted him to the office; he showed his passport, andinquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to M.sur M. by the mail-wagon; the seat beside the post-boy chanced to bevacant; he engaged it and paid for it.', '“Monsieur,” said the clerk, “donot fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o’clock in themorning.”This done, he left the hotel and began to wander about the town.He was not acquainted with Arras; the streets were dark, and he walkedon at random; but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of thepassers-by.', 'He crossed the little river Crinchon, and found himself ina labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way.', 'A citizen waspassing along with a lantern.', 'After some hesitation, he decided toapply to this man, not without having first glanced behind and in frontof him, as though he feared lest some one should hear the questionwhich he was about to put.“Monsieur,” said he, “where is the court-house, if you please.”“You do not belong in town, sir?” replied the bourgeois, who was anoldish man; “well, follow me.', 'I happen to be going in the direction ofthe court-house, that is to say, in the direction of the hotel of theprefecture; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at thismoment, and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in theprefecture.”“Is it there that the Assizes are held?” he asked.“Certainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was the bishop’spalace before the Revolution.', 'M. de Conzié, who was bishop in ’82,built a grand hall there.', 'It is in this grand hall that the court isheld.”On the way, the bourgeois said to him:—“If Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather late.', 'The sittingsgenerally close at six o’clock.”When they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed out tohim four long windows all lighted up, in the front of a vast and gloomybuilding.“Upon my word, sir, you are in luck; you have arrived in season.', 'Do yousee those four windows?', 'That is the Court of Assizes.', 'There is lightthere, so they are not through.', 'The matter must have been greatlyprotracted, and they are holding an evening session.', 'Do you take aninterest in this affair?', 'Is it a criminal case?', 'Are you a witness?”He replied:—“I have not come on any business; I only wish to speak to one of thelawyers.”“That is different,” said the bourgeois.', '“Stop, sir; here is the doorwhere the sentry stands.', 'You have only to ascend the grand staircase.”He conformed to the bourgeois’s directions, and a few minutes later hewas in a hall containing many people, and where groups, intermingledwith lawyers in their gowns, were whispering together here and there.It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of menrobed in black, murmuring together in low voices, on the threshold ofthe halls of justice.', 'It is rare that charity and pity are the outcomeof these words.', 'Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely tobe the result.', 'All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtfulobserver so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct inconcert all sorts of dark edifices.This spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the old hall ofthe episcopal palace, and served as the large hall of the palace ofjustice.', 'A double-leaved door, which was closed at that moment,separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting.The obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyerwhom he met.“What stage have they reached, sir?” he asked.“It is finished,” said the lawyer.“Finished!”This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round.“Excuse me sir; perhaps you are a relative?”“No; I know no one here.', 'Has judgment been pronounced?”“Of course.', 'Nothing else was possible.”“To penal servitude?”“For life.”He continued, in a voice so weak that it was barely audible:—“Then his identity was established?”“What identity?” replied the lawyer.', '“There was no identity to beestablished.', 'The matter was very simple.', 'The woman had murdered herchild; the infanticide was proved; the jury threw out the question ofpremeditation, and she was condemned for life.”“So it was a woman?” said he.“Why, certainly.', 'The Limosin woman.', 'Of what are you speaking?”“Nothing.', 'But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall is stilllighted?”“For another case, which was begun about two hours ago.”“What other case?”“Oh!', 'this one is a clear case also.', 'It is about a sort of blackguard; aman arrested for a second offence; a convict who has been guilty oftheft.', 'I don’t know his name exactly.', 'There’s a bandit’s phiz for you!I’d send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone.”“Is there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?” said he.“I really think that there is not.', 'There is a great crowd.', 'However, thehearing has been suspended.', 'Some people have gone out, and when thehearing is resumed, you might make an effort.”“Where is the entrance?”“Through yonder large door.”The lawyer left him.', 'In the course of a few moments he had experienced,almost simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, allpossible emotions.', 'The words of this indifferent spectator had, inturn, pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire.When he saw that nothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; buthe could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure.He drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying.', 'Thedocket of the session was very heavy; the president had appointed forthe same day two short and simple cases.', 'They had begun with theinfanticide, and now they had reached the convict, the old offender,the “return horse.” This man had stolen apples, but that did not appearto be entirely proved; what had been proved was, that he had alreadybeen in the galleys at Toulon.', 'It was that which lent a bad aspect tohis case.', 'However, the man’s examination and the depositions of thewitnesses had been completed, but the lawyer’s plea, and the speech ofthe public prosecutor were still to come; it could not be finishedbefore midnight.', 'The man would probably be condemned; theattorney-general was very clever, and never _missed_ his culprits; hewas a brilliant fellow who wrote verses.An usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes.He inquired of this usher:—“Will the door be opened soon, sir?”“It will not be opened at all,” replied the usher.“What!', 'It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed?', 'Is not thehearing suspended?”“The hearing has just been begun again,” replied the usher, “but thedoor will not be opened again.”“Why?”“Because the hall is full.”“What!', 'There is not room for one more?”“Not another one.', 'The door is closed.', 'No one can enter now.”The usher added after a pause: “There are, to tell the truth, two orthree extra places behind Monsieur le Président, but Monsieur lePrésident only admits public functionaries to them.”So saying, the usher turned his back.He retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, and slowlydescended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step.', 'It isprobable that he was holding counsel with himself.', 'The violent conflictwhich had been going on within him since the preceding evening was notyet ended; and every moment he encountered some new phase of it.', 'Onreaching the landing-place, he leaned his back against the balustersand folded his arms.', 'All at once he opened his coat, drew out hispocket-book, took from it a pencil, tore out a leaf, and upon that leafhe wrote rapidly, by the light of the street lantern, this line: _M.Madeleine, Mayor of M. sur M._; then he ascended the stairs once morewith great strides, made his way through the crowd, walked straight upto the usher, handed him the paper, and said in an authoritativemanner:—“Take this to Monsieur le Président.”The usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, and obeyed.CHAPTER VIII—AN ENTRANCE BY FAVORAlthough he did not suspect the fact, the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyed asort of celebrity.', 'For the space of seven years his reputation forvirtue had filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais; it had eventually passedthe confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through twoor three neighboring departments.', 'Besides the service which he hadrendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry,there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of thearrondissement of M. sur M. which was not indebted to him for somebenefit.', 'He had even at need contrived to aid and multiply theindustries of other arrondissements.', 'It was thus that he had, whenoccasion offered, supported with his credit and his funds the linenfactory at Boulogne, the flax-spinning industry at Frévent, and thehydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche.', 'Everywhere thename of M. Madeleine was pronounced with veneration.', 'Arras and Douaienvied the happy little town of M. sur M. its mayor.The Councillor of the Royal Court of Douai, who was presiding over thissession of the Assizes at Arras, was acquainted, in common with therest of the world, with this name which was so profoundly anduniversally honored.', 'When the usher, discreetly opening the door whichconnected the council-chamber with the court-room, bent over the backof the President’s armchair and handed him the paper on which wasinscribed the line which we have just perused, adding: “The gentlemandesires to be present at the trial,” the President, with a quick anddeferential movement, seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottomof the paper and returned it to the usher, saying, “Admit him.”The unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near thedoor of the hall, in the same place and the same attitude in which theusher had left him.', 'In the midst of his reverie he heard some onesaying to him, “Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow me?” It was thesame usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously,and who was now bowing to the earth before him.', 'At the same time, theusher handed him the paper.', 'He unfolded it, and as he chanced to benear the light, he could read it.“The President of the Court of Assizes presents his respects to M.Madeleine.”He crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained forhim a strange and bitter aftertaste.He followed the usher.A few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscotedcabinet of severe aspect, lighted by two wax candles, placed upon atable with a green cloth.', 'The last words of the usher who had justquitted him still rang in his ears: “Monsieur, you are now in thecouncil-chamber; you have only to turn the copper handle of yonderdoor, and you will find yourself in the court-room, behind thePresident’s chair.” These words were mingled in his thoughts with avague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he hadrecently traversed.The usher had left him alone.', 'The supreme moment had arrived.', 'He soughtto collect his faculties, but could not.', 'It is chiefly at the momentwhen there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painfulrealities of life, that the threads of thought snap within the brain.He was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned.With stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terribleapartment, where so many lives had been broken, which was soon to ringwith his name, and which his fate was at that moment traversing.', 'Hestared at the wall, then he looked at himself, wondering that it shouldbe that chamber and that it should be he.He had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours; he was worn out by thejolts of the cart, but he was not conscious of it.', 'It seemed to himthat he felt nothing.He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, and whichcontained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter of Jean NicolasPache, mayor of Paris and minister, and dated, through an error, nodoubt, the _9th of June_, of the year II., and in which Pache forwardedto the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest bythem.', 'Any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment, and whohad watched him, would have imagined, doubtless, that this letterstruck him as very curious, for he did not take his eyes from it, andhe read it two or three times.', 'He read it without paying any attentionto it, and unconsciously.', 'He was thinking of Fantine and Cosette.As he dreamed, he turned round, and his eyes fell upon the brass knobof the door which separated him from the Court of Assizes.', 'He hadalmost forgotten that door.', 'His glance, calm at first, paused there,remained fixed on that brass handle, then grew terrified, and little bylittle became impregnated with fear.', 'Beads of perspiration burst forthamong his hair and trickled down upon his temples.At a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort ofauthority mingled with rebellion, which is intended to convey, andwhich does so well convey, _“Pardieu!', 'who compels me to this?”_ Then hewheeled briskly round, caught sight of the door through which he hadentered in front of him, went to it, opened it, and passed out.', 'He wasno longer in that chamber; he was outside in a corridor, a long, narrowcorridor, broken by steps and gratings, making all sorts of angles,lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper ofinvalids, the corridor through which he had approached.', 'He breathed, helistened; not a sound in front, not a sound behind him, and he fled asthough pursued.When he had turned many angles in this corridor, he still listened.', 'Thesame silence reigned, and there was the same darkness around him.', 'Hewas out of breath; he staggered; he leaned against the wall.', 'The stonewas cold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his brow; he straightenedhimself up with a shiver.Then, there alone in the darkness, trembling with cold and withsomething else, too, perchance, he meditated.He had meditated all night long; he had meditated all the day: he heardwithin him but one voice, which said, “Alas!”A quarter of an hour passed thus.', 'At length he bowed his head, sighedwith agony, dropped his arms, and retraced his steps.', 'He walked slowly,and as though crushed.', 'It seemed as though some one had overtaken himin his flight and was leading him back.He re-entered the council-chamber.', 'The first thing he caught sight ofwas the knob of the door.', 'This knob, which was round and of polishedbrass, shone like a terrible star for him.', 'He gazed at it as a lambmight gaze into the eye of a tiger.He could not take his eyes from it.', 'From time to time he advanced astep and approached the door.Had he listened, he would have heard the sound of the adjoining halllike a sort of confused murmur; but he did not listen, and he did nothear.Suddenly, without himself knowing how it happened, he found himselfnear the door; he grasped the knob convulsively; the door opened.He was in the court-room.CHAPTER IX—A PLACE WHERE CONVICTIONS ARE IN PROCESS OF FORMATIONHe advanced a pace, closed the door mechanically behind him, andremained standing, contemplating what he saw.It was a vast and badly lighted apartment, now full of uproar, now fullof silence, where all the apparatus of a criminal case, with its pettyand mournful gravity in the midst of the throng, was in process ofdevelopment.At the one end of the hall, the one where he was, were judges, withabstracted air, in threadbare robes, who were gnawing their nails orclosing their eyelids; at the other end, a ragged crowd; lawyers in allsorts of attitudes; soldiers with hard but honest faces; ancient,spotted woodwork, a dirty ceiling, tables covered with serge that wasyellow rather than green; doors blackened by handmarks; tap-room lampswhich emitted more smoke than light, suspended from nails in thewainscot; on the tables candles in brass candlesticks; darkness,ugliness, sadness; and from all this there was disengaged an austereand august impression, for one there felt that grand human thing whichis called the law, and that grand divine thing which is called justice.No one in all that throng paid any attention to him; all glances weredirected towards a single point, a wooden bench placed against a smalldoor, in the stretch of wall on the President’s left; on this bench,illuminated by several candles, sat a man between two gendarmes.This man was _the_ man.He did not seek him; he saw him; his eyes went thither naturally, asthough they had known beforehand where that figure was.He thought he was looking at himself, grown old; not absolutely thesame in face, of course, but exactly similar in attitude and aspect,with his bristling hair, with that wild and uneasy eye, with thatblouse, just as it was on the day when he entered D——, full of hatred,concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which hehad spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison.He said to himself with a shudder, “Good God!', 'shall I become like thatagain?”This creature seemed to be at least sixty; there was somethingindescribably coarse, stupid, and frightened about him.At the sound made by the opening door, people had drawn aside to makeway for him; the President had turned his head, and, understanding thatthe personage who had just entered was the mayor of M. sur M., he hadbowed to him; the attorney-general, who had seen M. Madeleine at M.', 'surM., whither the duties of his office had called him more than once,recognized him and saluted him also: he had hardly perceived it; he wasthe victim of a sort of hallucination; he was watching.Judges, clerks, gendarmes, a throng of cruelly curious heads, all thesehe had already beheld once, in days gone by, twenty-seven years before;he had encountered those fatal things once more; there they were; theymoved; they existed; it was no longer an effort of his memory, a mirageof his thought; they were real gendarmes and real judges, a real crowd,and real men of flesh and blood: it was all over; he beheld themonstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him,with all that there is formidable in reality.All this was yawning before him.He was horrified by it; he shut his eyes, and exclaimed in the deepestrecesses of his soul, “Never!”And by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble, andrendered him nearly mad, it was another self of his that was there!', 'allcalled that man who was being tried Jean Valjean.Under his very eyes, unheard-of vision, he had a sort of representationof the most horrible moment of his life, enacted by his spectre.Everything was there; the apparatus was the same, the hour of thenight, the faces of the judges, of soldiers, and of spectators; allwere the same, only above the President’s head there hung a crucifix,something which the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation:God had been absent when he had been judged.There was a chair behind him; he dropped into it, terrified at thethought that he might be seen; when he was seated, he took advantage ofa pile of cardboard boxes, which stood on the judge’s desk, to concealhis face from the whole room; he could now see without being seen; hehad fully regained consciousness of the reality of things; gradually herecovered; he attained that phase of composure where it is possible tolisten.M.', 'Bamatabois was one of the jurors.He looked for Javert, but did not see him; the seat of the witnesseswas hidden from him by the clerk’s table, and then, as we have justsaid, the hall was sparely lighted.At the moment of this entrance, the defendant’s lawyer had justfinished his plea.The attention of all was excited to the highest pitch; the affair hadlasted for three hours: for three hours that crowd had been watching astrange man, a miserable specimen of humanity, either profoundly stupidor profoundly subtle, gradually bending beneath the weight of aterrible likeness.', 'This man, as the reader already knows, was avagabond who had been found in a field carrying a branch laden withripe apples, broken in the orchard of a neighbor, called the Pierronorchard.', 'Who was this man?', 'an examination had been made; witnesses hadbeen heard, and they were unanimous; light had abounded throughout theentire debate; the accusation said: “We have in our grasp not only amarauder, a stealer of fruit; we have here, in our hands, a bandit, anold offender who has broken his ban, an ex-convict, a miscreant of themost dangerous description, a malefactor named Jean Valjean, whomjustice has long been in search of, and who, eight years ago, onemerging from the galleys at Toulon, committed a highway robbery,accompanied by violence, on the person of a child, a Savoyard namedLittle Gervais; a crime provided for by article 383 of the Penal Code,the right to try him for which we reserve hereafter, when his identityshall have been judicially established.', 'He has just committed a freshtheft; it is a case of a second offence; condemn him for the freshdeed; later on he will be judged for the old crime.” In the face ofthis accusation, in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses, theaccused appeared to be astonished more than anything else; he madesigns and gestures which were meant to convey No, or else he stared atthe ceiling: he spoke with difficulty, replied with embarrassment, buthis whole person, from head to foot, was a denial; he was an idiot inthe presence of all these minds ranged in order of battle around him,and like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fastupon him; nevertheless, it was a question of the most menacing futurefor him; the likeness increased every moment, and the entire crowdsurveyed, with more anxiety than he did himself, that sentencefreighted with calamity, which descended ever closer over his head;there was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded; besides thegalleys, a possible death penalty, in case his identity wereestablished, and the affair of Little Gervais were to end thereafter incondemnation.', 'Who was this man?', 'what was the nature of his apathy?', 'wasit imbecility or craft?', 'Did he understand too well, or did he notunderstand at all?', 'these were questions which divided the crowd, andseemed to divide the jury; there was something both terrible andpuzzling in this case: the drama was not only melancholy; it was alsoobscure.The counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well, in thatprovincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar,and which was formerly employed by all advocates, at Paris as well asat Romorantin or at Montbrison, and which to-day, having becomeclassic, is no longer spoken except by the official orators ofmagistracy, to whom it is suited on account of its grave sonorousnessand its majestic stride; a tongue in which a husband is called _aconsort_, and a woman _a spouse_; Paris, _the centre of art andcivilization_; the king, _the monarch_; Monseigneur the Bishop, _asainted pontiff_; the district-attorney, _the eloquent interpreter ofpublic prosecution_; the arguments, _the accents which we have justlistened to_; the age of Louis XIV., _the grand age_; a theatre, _thetemple of Melpomene_; the reigning family, _the august blood of ourkings_; a concert, _a musical solemnity_; the General Commandant of theprovince, _the illustrious warrior, who, etc._; the pupils in theseminary, _these tender levities_; errors imputed to newspapers, _theimposture which distills its venom through the columns of thoseorgans_; etc.', 'The lawyer had, accordingly, begun with an explanation asto the theft of the apples,—an awkward matter couched in fine style;but Bénigne Bossuet himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in themidst of a funeral oration, and he extricated himself from thesituation in stately fashion.', 'The lawyer established the fact that thetheft of the apples had not been circumstantially proved.', 'His client,whom he, in his character of counsel, persisted in callingChampmathieu, had not been seen scaling that wall nor breaking thatbranch by any one.', 'He had been taken with that branch (which the lawyerpreferred to call a _bough_) in his possession; but he said that he hadfound it broken off and lying on the ground, and had picked it up.Where was there any proof to the contrary?', 'No doubt that branch hadbeen broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall, thenthrown away by the alarmed marauder; there was no doubt that there hadbeen a thief in the case.', 'But what proof was there that that thief hadbeen Champmathieu?', 'One thing only.', 'His character as an ex-convict.', 'Thelawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be, unhappily, wellattested; the accused had resided at Faverolles; the accused hadexercised the calling of a tree-pruner there; the name of Champmathieumight well have had its origin in Jean Mathieu; all that was true,—inshort, four witnesses recognize Champmathieu, positively and withouthesitation, as that convict, Jean Valjean; to these signs, to thistestimony, the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of hisclient, the denial of an interested party; but supposing that he wasthe convict Jean Valjean, did that prove that he was the thief of theapples?', 'that was a presumption at the most, not a proof.', 'The prisoner,it was true, and his counsel, “in good faith,” was obliged to admit it,had adopted “a bad system of defence.” He obstinately deniedeverything, the theft and his character of convict.', 'An admission uponthis last point would certainly have been better, and would have wonfor him the indulgence of his judges; the counsel had advised him to dothis; but the accused had obstinately refused, thinking, no doubt, thathe would save everything by admitting nothing.', 'It was an error; butought not the paucity of this intelligence to be taken intoconsideration?', 'This man was visibly stupid.', 'Long-continued wretchednessin the galleys, long misery outside the galleys, had brutalized him,etc.', 'He defended himself badly; was that a reason for condemning him?As for the affair with Little Gervais, the counsel need not discuss it;it did not enter into the case.', 'The lawyer wound up by beseeching thejury and the court, if the identity of Jean Valjean appeared to them tobe evident, to apply to him the police penalties which are provided fora criminal who has broken his ban, and not the frightful chastisementwhich descends upon the convict guilty of a second offence.The district-attorney answered the counsel for the defence.', 'He wasviolent and florid, as district-attorneys usually are.He congratulated the counsel for the defence on his “loyalty,” andskilfully took advantage of this loyalty.', 'He reached the accusedthrough all the concessions made by his lawyer.', 'The advocate had seemedto admit that the prisoner was Jean Valjean.', 'He took note of this.', 'Sothis man was Jean Valjean.', 'This point had been conceded to theaccusation and could no longer be disputed.', 'Here, by means of a cleverautonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime, thedistrict-attorney thundered against the immorality of the romanticschool, then dawning under the name of _the Satanic school_, which hadbeen bestowed upon it by the critics of the _Quotidienne_ and the_Oriflamme_; he attributed, not without some probability, to theinfluence of this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, orrather, to speak more correctly, of Jean Valjean.', 'Having exhaustedthese considerations, he passed on to Jean Valjean himself.', 'Who wasthis Jean Valjean?', 'Description of Jean Valjean: a monster spewed forth,etc.', 'The model for this sort of description is contained in the tale ofThéramène, which is not useful to tragedy, but which every day rendersgreat services to judicial eloquence.', 'The audience and the jury“shuddered.” The description finished, the district-attorney resumedwith an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of thejournal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day:And it is such a man, etc., etc., etc., vagabond, beggar, without meansof existence, etc., etc., inured by his past life to culpable deeds,and but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys, as was proved bythe crime committed against Little Gervais, etc., etc.', '; it is such aman, caught upon the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces froma wall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand the objectstolen, who denies the crime, the theft, the climbing the wall; denieseverything; denies even his own identity!', 'In addition to a hundredother proofs, to which we will not recur, four witnesses recognizehim—Javert, the upright inspector of police; Javert, and three of hisformer companions in infamy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, andCochepaille.', 'What does he offer in opposition to this overwhelmingunanimity?', 'His denial.', 'What obduracy!', 'You will do justice, gentlemen ofthe jury, etc., etc.', 'While the district-attorney was speaking, theaccused listened to him open-mouthed, with a sort of amazement in whichsome admiration was assuredly blended.', 'He was evidently surprised thata man could talk like that.', 'From time to time, at those “energetic”moments of the prosecutor’s speech, when eloquence which cannot containitself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops theaccused like a storm, he moved his head slowly from right to left andfrom left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest withwhich he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument.', 'Twoor three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say ina low voice, “That is what comes of not having asked M. Baloup.” Thedistrict-attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupidattitude, evidently deliberate, which denoted not imbecility, butcraft, skill, a habit of deceiving justice, and which set forth in allits nakedness the “profound perversity” of this man.', 'He ended by makinghis reserves on the affair of Little Gervais and demanding a severesentence.At that time, as the reader will remember, it was penal servitude forlife.The counsel for the defence rose, began by complimenting Monsieurl’Avocat-General on his “admirable speech,” then replied as best hecould; but he weakened; the ground was evidently slipping away fromunder his feet.CHAPTER X—THE SYSTEM OF DENIALSThe moment for closing the debate had arrived.', 'The President had theaccused stand up, and addressed to him the customary question, “Haveyou anything to add to your defence?”The man did not appear to understand, as he stood there, twisting inhis hands a terrible cap which he had.The President repeated the question.This time the man heard it.', 'He seemed to understand.', 'He made a motionlike a man who is just waking up, cast his eyes about him, stared atthe audience, the gendarmes, his counsel, the jury, the court, laid hismonstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench, tookanother look, and all at once, fixing his glance upon thedistrict-attorney, he began to speak.', 'It was like an eruption.', 'Itseemed, from the manner in which the words escaped from hismouth,—incoherent, impetuous, pell-mell, tumbling over each other,—asthough they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once.', 'He said:—“This is what I have to say.', 'That I have been a wheelwright in Paris,and that it was with Monsieur Baloup.', 'It is a hard trade.', 'In thewheelwright’s trade one works always in the open air, in courtyards,under sheds when the masters are good, never in closed workshops,because space is required, you see.', 'In winter one gets so cold that onebeats one’s arms together to warm one’s self; but the masters don’tlike it; they say it wastes time.', 'Handling iron when there is icebetween the paving-stones is hard work.', 'That wears a man out quickly.One is old while he is still quite young in that trade.', 'At forty a manis done for.', 'I was fifty-three.', 'I was in a bad state.', 'And then, workmenare so mean!', 'When a man is no longer young, they call him nothing butan old bird, old beast!', 'I was not earning more than thirty sous a day.They paid me as little as possible.', 'The masters took advantage of myage—and then I had my daughter, who was a laundress at the river.', 'Sheearned a little also.', 'It sufficed for us two.', 'She had trouble, also;all day long up to her waist in a tub, in rain, in snow.', 'When the windcuts your face, when it freezes, it is all the same; you must stillwash.', 'There are people who have not much linen, and wait until late; ifyou do not wash, you lose your custom.', 'The planks are badly joined, andwater drops on you from everywhere; you have your petticoats all dampabove and below.', 'That penetrates.', 'She has also worked at the laundry ofthe Enfants-Rouges, where the water comes through faucets.', 'You are notin the tub there; you wash at the faucet in front of you, and rinse ina basin behind you.', 'As it is enclosed, you are not so cold; but thereis that hot steam, which is terrible, and which ruins your eyes.', 'Shecame home at seven o’clock in the evening, and went to bed at once, shewas so tired.', 'Her husband beat her.', 'She is dead.', 'We have not been veryhappy.', 'She was a good girl, who did not go to the ball, and who wasvery peaceable.', 'I remember one Shrove-Tuesday when she went to bed ateight o’clock.', 'There, I am telling the truth; you have only to ask.', 'Ah,yes!', 'how stupid I am!', 'Paris is a gulf.', 'Who knows Father Champmathieuthere?', 'But M. Baloup does, I tell you.', 'Go see at M. Baloup’s; and afterall, I don’t know what is wanted of me.”The man ceased speaking, and remained standing.', 'He had said thesethings in a loud, rapid, hoarse voice, with a sort of irritated andsavage ingenuousness.', 'Once he paused to salute some one in the crowd.The sort of affirmations which he seemed to fling out before him atrandom came like hiccoughs, and to each he added the gesture of awood-cutter who is splitting wood.', 'When he had finished, the audienceburst into a laugh.', 'He stared at the public, and, perceiving that theywere laughing, and not understanding why, he began to laugh himself.It was inauspicious.The President, an attentive and benevolent man, raised his voice.He reminded “the gentlemen of the jury” that “the sieur Baloup,formerly a master-wheelwright, with whom the accused stated that he hadserved, had been summoned in vain.', 'He had become bankrupt, and was notto be found.” Then turning to the accused, he enjoined him to listen towhat he was about to say, and added: “You are in a position wherereflection is necessary.', 'The gravest presumptions rest upon you, andmay induce vital results.', 'Prisoner, in your own interests, I summon youfor the last time to explain yourself clearly on two points.', 'In thefirst place, did you or did you not climb the wall of the Pierronorchard, break the branch, and steal the apples; that is to say, committhe crime of breaking in and theft?', 'In the second place, are you thedischarged convict, Jean Valjean—yes or no?”The prisoner shook his head with a capable air, like a man who hasthoroughly understood, and who knows what answer he is going to make.He opened his mouth, turned towards the President, and said:—“In the first place—”Then he stared at his cap, stared at the ceiling, and held his peace.“Prisoner,” said the district-attorney, in a severe voice; “payattention.', 'You are not answering anything that has been asked of you.Your embarrassment condemns you.', 'It is evident that your name is notChampmathieu; that you are the convict, Jean Valjean, concealed firstunder the name of Jean Mathieu, which was the name of his mother; thatyou went to Auvergne; that you were born at Faverolles, where you werea pruner of trees.', 'It is evident that you have been guilty of entering,and of the theft of ripe apples from the Pierron orchard.', 'The gentlemenof the jury will form their own opinion.”  EnlargeFather Champmathieu on TrialThe prisoner had finally resumed his seat; he arose abruptly when thedistrict-attorney had finished, and exclaimed:—“You are very wicked; that you are!', 'This what I wanted to say; I couldnot find words for it at first.', 'I have stolen nothing.', 'I am a man whodoes not have something to eat every day.', 'I was coming from Ailly; Iwas walking through the country after a shower, which had made thewhole country yellow: even the ponds were overflowed, and nothingsprang from the sand any more but the little blades of grass at thewayside.', 'I found a broken branch with apples on the ground; I picked upthe branch without knowing that it would get me into trouble.', 'I havebeen in prison, and they have been dragging me about for the last threemonths; more than that I cannot say; people talk against me, they tellme, ‘Answer!’ The gendarme, who is a good fellow, nudges my elbow, andsays to me in a low voice, ‘Come, answer!’ I don’t know how to explain;I have no education; I am a poor man; that is where they wrong me,because they do not see this.', 'I have not stolen; I picked up from theground things that were lying there.', 'You say, Jean Valjean, JeanMathieu!', 'I don’t know those persons; they are villagers.', 'I worked forM.', 'Baloup, Boulevard de l’Hôpital; my name is Champmathieu.', 'You arevery clever to tell me where I was born; I don’t know myself: it’s noteverybody who has a house in which to come into the world; that wouldbe too convenient.', 'I think that my father and mother were people whostrolled along the highways; I know nothing different.', 'When I was achild, they called me _young fellow_; now they call me _old Fellow_;those are my baptismal names; take that as you like.', 'I have been inAuvergne; I have been at Faverolles.', 'Pardi.', 'Well!', 'can’t a man have beenin Auvergne, or at Faverolles, without having been in the galleys?', 'Itell you that I have not stolen, and that I am Father Champmathieu; Ihave been with M. Baloup; I have had a settled residence.', 'You worry mewith your nonsense, there!', 'Why is everybody pursuing me so furiously?”The district-attorney had remained standing; he addressed thePresident:—“Monsieur le Président, in view of the confused but exceedingly cleverdenials of the prisoner, who would like to pass himself off as anidiot, but who will not succeed in so doing,—we shall attend tothat,—we demand that it shall please you and that it shall please thecourt to summon once more into this place the convicts Brevet,Cochepaille, and Chenildieu, and Police-Inspector Javert, and questionthem for the last time as to the identity of the prisoner with theconvict Jean Valjean.”“I would remind the district-attorney,” said the President, “thatPolice-Inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the capital of aneighboring arrondissement, left the court-room and the town as soon ashe had made his deposition; we have accorded him permission, with theconsent of the district-attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner.”“That is true, Mr. President,” responded the district-attorney.', '“In theabsence of sieur Javert, I think it my duty to remind the gentlemen ofthe jury of what he said here a few hours ago.', 'Javert is an estimableman, who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior butimportant functions.', 'These are the terms of his deposition: ‘I do noteven stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions togive the lie to the prisoner’s denial.', 'I recognize him perfectly.', 'Thename of this man is not Champmathieu; he is an ex-convict named JeanValjean, and is very vicious and much to be feared.', 'It is only withextreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term.', 'Heunderwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft.', 'He made five orsix attempts to escape.', 'Besides the theft from Little Gervais, and fromthe Pierron orchard, I suspect him of a theft committed in the house ofHis Grace the late Bishop of D—— I often saw him at the time when I wasadjutant of the galley-guard at the prison in Toulon.', 'I repeat that Irecognize him perfectly.’”This extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impressionon the public and on the jury.', 'The district-attorney concluded byinsisting, that in default of Javert, the three witnesses Brevet,Chenildieu, and Cochepaille should be heard once more and solemnlyinterrogated.The President transmitted the order to an usher, and, a moment later,the door of the witnesses’ room opened.', 'The usher, accompanied by agendarme ready to lend him armed assistance, introduced the convictBrevet.', 'The audience was in suspense; and all breasts heaved as thoughthey had contained but one soul.The ex-convict Brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the centralprisons.', 'Brevet was a person sixty years of age, who had a sort ofbusiness man’s face, and the air of a rascal.', 'The two sometimes gotogether.', 'In prison, whither fresh misdeeds had led him, he had becomesomething in the nature of a turnkey.', 'He was a man of whom hissuperiors said, “He tries to make himself of use.” The chaplains boregood testimony as to his religious habits.', 'It must not be forgottenthat this passed under the Restoration.“Brevet,” said the President, “you have undergone an ignominioussentence, and you cannot take an oath.”Brevet dropped his eyes.“Nevertheless,” continued the President, “even in the man whom the lawhas degraded, there may remain, when the divine mercy permits it, asentiment of honor and of equity.', 'It is to this sentiment that I appealat this decisive hour.', 'If it still exists in you,—and I hope itdoes,—reflect before replying to me: consider on the one hand, thisman, whom a word from you may ruin; on the other hand, justice, which aword from you may enlighten.', 'The instant is solemn; there is still timeto retract if you think you have been mistaken.', 'Rise, prisoner.', 'Brevet,take a good look at the accused, recall your souvenirs, and tell us onyour soul and conscience, if you persist in recognizing this man asyour former companion in the galleys, Jean Valjean?”Brevet looked at the prisoner, then turned towards the court.“Yes, Mr. President, I was the first to recognize him, and I stick toit; that man is Jean Valjean, who entered at Toulon in 1796, and leftin 1815.', 'I left a year later.', 'He has the air of a brute now; but itmust be because age has brutalized him; he was sly at the galleys: Irecognize him positively.”“Take your seat,” said the President.', '“Prisoner, remain standing.”Chenildieu was brought in, a prisoner for life, as was indicated by hisred cassock and his green cap.', 'He was serving out his sentence at thegalleys of Toulon, whence he had been brought for this case.', 'He was asmall man of about fifty, brisk, wrinkled, frail, yellow, brazen-faced,feverish, who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs andhis whole person, and an immense force in his glance.', 'His companions inthe galleys had nicknamed him _I-deny-God_ (_Je-nie Dieu_, Chenildieu).The President addressed him in nearly the same words which he had usedto Brevet.', 'At the moment when he reminded him of his infamy whichdeprived him of the right to take an oath, Chenildieu raised his headand looked the crowd in the face.', 'The President invited him toreflection, and asked him as he had asked Brevet, if he persisted inrecognition of the prisoner.Chenildieu burst out laughing.“Pardieu, as if I didn’t recognize him!', 'We were attached to the samechain for five years.', 'So you are sulking, old fellow?”“Go take your seat,” said the President.The usher brought in Cochepaille.', 'He was another convict for life, whohad come from the galleys, and was dressed in red, like Chenildieu, wasa peasant from Lourdes, and a half-bear of the Pyrenees.', 'He had guardedthe flocks among the mountains, and from a shepherd he had slipped intoa brigand.', 'Cochepaille was no less savage and seemed even more stupidthan the prisoner.', 'He was one of those wretched men whom nature hassketched out for wild beasts, and on whom society puts the finishingtouches as convicts in the galleys.The President tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words,and asked him, as he had asked the other two, if he persisted, withouthesitation or trouble, in recognizing the man who was standing beforehim.“He is Jean Valjean,” said Cochepaille.', '“He was even calledJean-the-Screw, because he was so strong.”Each of these affirmations from these three men, evidently sincere andin good faith, had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury forthe prisoner,—a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time thata fresh declaration was added to the proceeding.The prisoner had listened to them, with that astounded face which was,according to the accusation, his principal means of defence; at thefirst, the gendarmes, his neighbors, had heard him mutter between histeeth: “Ah, well, he’s a nice one!” after the second, he said, a littlelouder, with an air that was almost that of satisfaction, “Good!” atthe third, he cried, “Famous!”The President addressed him:—“Have you heard, prisoner?', 'What have you to say?”He replied:—“I say, ‘Famous!’”An uproar broke out among the audience, and was communicated to thejury; it was evident that the man was lost.“Ushers,” said the President, “enforce silence!', 'I am going to sum upthe arguments.”At that moment there was a movement just beside the President; a voicewas heard crying:—“Brevet!', 'Chenildieu!', 'Cochepaille!', 'look here!”All who heard that voice were chilled, so lamentable and terrible wasit; all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded.', 'A man,placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind thecourt, had just risen, had pushed open the half-door which separatedthe tribunal from the audience, and was standing in the middle of thehall; the President, the district-attorney, M. Bamatabois, twentypersons, recognized him, and exclaimed in concert:—“M.', 'Madeleine!”CHAPTER XI—CHAMPMATHIEU MORE AND MORE ASTONISHEDIt was he, in fact.', 'The clerk’s lamp illumined his countenance.', 'He heldhis hat in his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; his coatwas carefully buttoned; he was very pale, and he trembled slightly; hishair, which had still been gray on his arrival in Arras, was nowentirely white: it had turned white during the hour he had sat there.All heads were raised: the sensation was indescribable; there was amomentary hesitation in the audience, the voice had been soheart-rending; the man who stood there appeared so calm that they didnot understand at first.', 'They asked themselves whether he had indeeduttered that cry; they could not believe that that tranquil man hadbeen the one to give that terrible outcry.This indecision only lasted a few seconds.', 'Even before the Presidentand the district-attorney could utter a word, before the ushers and thegendarmes could make a gesture, the man whom all still called, at thatmoment, M. Madeleine, had advanced towards the witnesses Cochepaille,Brevet, and Chenildieu.“Do you not recognize me?” said he.All three remained speechless, and indicated by a sign of the head thatthey did not know him.', 'Cochepaille, who was intimidated, made amilitary salute.', 'M. Madeleine turned towards the jury and the court,and said in a gentle voice:—“Gentlemen of the jury, order the prisoner to be released!', 'Mr.President, have me arrested.', 'He is not the man whom you are in searchof; it is I: I am Jean Valjean.”Not a mouth breathed; the first commotion of astonishment had beenfollowed by a silence like that of the grave; those within the hallexperienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses whensomething grand has been done.In the meantime, the face of the President was stamped with sympathyand sadness; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorneyand a few low-toned words with the assistant judges; he addressed thepublic, and asked in accents which all understood:—“Is there a physician present?”The district-attorney took the word:—“Gentlemen of the jury, the very strange and unexpected incident whichdisturbs the audience inspires us, like yourselves, only with asentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express.', 'You all know, byreputation at least, the honorable M. Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M.; ifthere is a physician in the audience, we join the President inrequesting him to attend to M.

MADELEINE CONTEMPLATES HIS HAIRThe day had begun to dawn.', 'Fantine had passed a sleepless and feverishnight, filled with happy visions; at daybreak she fell asleep.', 'SisterSimplice, who had been watching with her, availed herself of thisslumber to go and prepare a new potion of chinchona.', 'The worthy sisterhad been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments, bendingover her drugs and phials, and scrutinizing things very closely, onaccount of the dimness which the half-light of dawn spreads over allobjects.', 'Suddenly she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek.', 'M.Madeleine stood before her; he had just entered silently.“Is it you, Mr. Mayor?” she exclaimed.He replied in a low voice:—“How is that poor woman?”“Not so bad just now; but we have been very uneasy.”She explained to him what had passed: that Fantine had been very illthe day before, and that she was better now, because she thought thatthe mayor had gone to Montfermeil to get her child.', 'The sister darednot question the mayor; but she perceived plainly from his air that hehad not come from there.“All that is good,” said he; “you were right not to undeceive her.”“Yes,” responded the sister; “but now, Mr. Mayor, she will see you andwill not see her child.', 'What shall we say to her?”He reflected for a moment.“God will inspire us,” said he.“But we cannot tell a lie,” murmured the sister, half aloud.It was broad daylight in the room.', 'The light fell full on M.Madeleine’s face.', 'The sister chanced to raise her eyes to it.“Good God, sir!” she exclaimed; “what has happened to you?', 'Your hair isperfectly white!”“White!” said he.Sister Simplice had no mirror.', 'She rummaged in a drawer, and pulled outthe little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whethera patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed.', 'M. Madeleine tookthe mirror, looked at his hair, and said:—“Well!”He uttered the word indifferently, and as though his mind were onsomething else.The sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught aglimpse in all this.He inquired:—“Can I see her?”“Is not Monsieur le Maire going to have her child brought back to her?”said the sister, hardly venturing to put the question.“Of course; but it will take two or three days at least.”“If she were not to see Monsieur le Maire until that time,” went on thesister, timidly, “she would not know that Monsieur le Maire hadreturned, and it would be easy to inspire her with patience; and whenthe child arrived, she would naturally think Monsieur le Maire had justcome with the child.', 'We should not have to enact a lie.”M.', 'Madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments; then he said with hiscalm gravity:—“No, sister, I must see her.', 'I may, perhaps, be in haste.”The nun did not appear to notice this word “perhaps,” whichcommunicated an obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor’sspeech.', 'She replied, lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully:—“In that case, she is asleep; but Monsieur le Maire may enter.”He made some remarks about a door which shut badly, and the noise ofwhich might awaken the sick woman; then he entered Fantine’s chamber,approached the bed and drew aside the curtains.', 'She was asleep.', 'Herbreath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiarto those maladies, and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they arewatching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemnedto death.', 'But this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort ofineffable serenity which overspread her countenance, and whichtransfigured her in her sleep.', 'Her pallor had become whiteness; hercheeks were crimson; her long golden lashes, the only beauty of heryouth and her virginity which remained to her, palpitated, though theyremained closed and drooping.', 'Her whole person was trembling with anindescribable unfolding of wings, all ready to open wide and bear heraway, which could be felt as they rustled, though they could not beseen.', 'To see her thus, one would never have dreamed that she was aninvalid whose life was almost despaired of.', 'She resembled rathersomething on the point of soaring away than something on the point ofdying.The branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower, andseems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time.The human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives inwhich the mysterious fingers of Death are about to pluck the soul.M.', 'Madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed, gazingin turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix, as he had done two monthsbefore, on the day when he had come for the first time to see her inthat asylum.', 'They were both still there in the same attitude—shesleeping, he praying; only now, after the lapse of two months, her hairwas gray and his was white.The sister had not entered with him.', 'He stood beside the bed, with hisfinger on his lips, as though there were some one in the chamber whomhe must enjoin to silence.She opened her eyes, saw him, and said quietly, with a smile:—“And Cosette?”CHAPTER II—FANTINE HAPPYShe made no movement of either surprise or of joy; she was joy itself.That simple question, “And Cosette?” was put with so profound a faith,with so much certainty, with such a complete absence of disquiet and ofdoubt, that he found not a word of reply.', 'She continued:—“I knew that you were there.', 'I was asleep, but I saw you.', 'I have seenyou for a long, long time.', 'I have been following you with my eyes allnight long.', 'You were in a glory, and you had around you all sorts ofcelestial forms.”He raised his glance to the crucifix.“But,” she resumed, “tell me where Cosette is.', 'Why did not you placeher on my bed against the moment of my waking?”He made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able torecall.Fortunately, the doctor had been warned, and he now made hisappearance.', 'He came to the aid of M. Madeleine.“Calm yourself, my child,” said the doctor; “your child is here.”Fantine’s eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light.', 'She claspedher hands with an expression which contained all that is possible toprayer in the way of violence and tenderness.“Oh!” she exclaimed, “bring her to me!”Touching illusion of a mother!', 'Cosette was, for her, still the littlechild who is carried.“Not yet,” said the doctor, “not just now.', 'You still have some fever.The sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm.', 'You must becured first.”She interrupted him impetuously:—“But I am cured!', 'Oh, I tell you that I am cured!', 'What an ass thatdoctor is!', 'The idea!', 'I want to see my child!”“You see,” said the doctor, “how excited you become.', 'So long as you arein this state I shall oppose your having your child.', 'It is not enoughto see her; it is necessary that you should live for her.', 'When you arereasonable, I will bring her to you myself.”The poor mother bowed her head.“I beg your pardon, doctor, I really beg your pardon.', 'Formerly I shouldnever have spoken as I have just done; so many misfortunes havehappened to me, that I sometimes do not know what I am saying.', 'Iunderstand you; you fear the emotion.', 'I will wait as long as you like,but I swear to you that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter.I have been seeing her; I have not taken my eyes from her sinceyesterday evening.', 'Do you know?', 'If she were brought to me now, I shouldtalk to her very gently.', 'That is all.', 'Is it not quite natural that Ishould desire to see my daughter, who has been brought to me expresslyfrom Montfermeil?', 'I am not angry.', 'I know well that I am about to behappy.', 'All night long I have seen white things, and persons who smiledat me.', 'When Monsieur le Docteur pleases, he shall bring me Cosette.', 'Ihave no longer any fever; I am well.', 'I am perfectly conscious thatthere is nothing the matter with me any more; but I am going to behaveas though I were ill, and not stir, to please these ladies here.', 'Whenit is seen that I am very calm, they will say, ‘She must have herchild.’”M.', 'Madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed.', 'She turned towardshim; she was making a visible effort to be calm and “very good,” as sheexpressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy, inorder that, seeing her so peaceable, they might make no difficultyabout bringing Cosette to her.', 'But while she controlled herself shecould not refrain from questioning M.

Madeleine quittedthe Hall of Assizes in Arras.', 'He regained his inn just in time to setout again by the mail-wagon, in which he had engaged his place.', 'Alittle before six o’clock in the morning he had arrived at M. sur M.,and his first care had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte, then toenter the infirmary and see Fantine.However, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court ofAssizes, when the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock,had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of M.sur M., to declare that his convictions had not been in the leastmodified by that curious incident, which would be explained thereafter,and to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation of that Champmathieu,who was evidently the real Jean Valjean.', 'The district-attorney’spersistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one,of the public, of the court, and of the jury.', 'The counsel for thedefence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and inestablishing that, in consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine,that is to say, of the real Jean Valjean, the aspect of the matter hadbeen thoroughly altered, and that the jury had before their eyes nowonly an innocent man.', 'Thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, notvery fresh, unfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., etc.', '; thePresident, in his summing up, had joined the counsel for the defence,and in a few minutes the jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.Nevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean Valjean;and as he had no longer Champmathieu, he took Madeleine.Immediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, thedistrict-attorney shut himself up with the President.', 'They conferred“as to the necessity of seizing the person of M. le Maire of M. sur M.”This phrase, in which there was a great deal of _of_, is thedistrict-attorney’s, written with his own hand, on the minutes of hisreport to the attorney-general.', 'His first emotion having passed off,the President did not offer many objections.', 'Justice must, after all,take its course.', 'And then, when all was said, although the Presidentwas a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man, he was, at the same time,a devoted and almost an ardent royalist, and he had been shocked tohear the Mayor of M. sur M. say the _Emperor_, and not _Bonaparte_,when alluding to the landing at Cannes.The order for his arrest was accordingly despatched.', 'Thedistrict-attorney forwarded it to M. sur M. by a special messenger, atfull speed, and entrusted its execution to Police Inspector Javert.The reader knows that Javert had returned to M. sur M. immediatelyafter having given his deposition.Javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him theorder of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner.The messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, intwo words, informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras.', 'The orderof arrest, signed by the district-attorney, was couched in these words:“Inspector Javert will apprehend the body of the Sieur Madeleine, mayorof M. sur M., who, in this day’s session of the court, was recognizedas the liberated convict, Jean Valjean.”Any one who did not know Javert, and who had chanced to see him at themoment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary, could havedivined nothing of what had taken place, and would have thought his airthe most ordinary in the world.', 'He was cool, calm, grave, his gray hairwas perfectly smooth upon his temples, and he had just mounted thestairs with his habitual deliberation.', 'Any one who was thoroughlyacquainted with him, and who had examined him attentively at themoment, would have shuddered.', 'The buckle of his leather stock was underhis left ear instead of at the nape of his neck.', 'This betrayed unwontedagitation.Javert was a complete character, who never had a wrinkle in his duty orin his uniform; methodical with malefactors, rigid with the buttons ofhis coat.That he should have set the buckle of his stock awry, it wasindispensable that there should have taken place in him one of thoseemotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes.He had come in a simple way, had made a requisition on the neighboringpost for a corporal and four soldiers, had left the soldiers in thecourtyard, had had Fantine’s room pointed out to him by the portress,who was utterly unsuspicious, accustomed as she was to seeing armed meninquiring for the mayor.On arriving at Fantine’s chamber, Javert turned the handle, pushed thedoor open with the gentleness of a sick-nurse or a police spy, andentered.Properly speaking, he did not enter.', 'He stood erect in the half-opendoor, his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat, whichwas buttoned up to the chin.', 'In the bend of his elbow the leaden headof his enormous cane, which was hidden behind him, could be seen.Thus he remained for nearly a minute, without his presence beingperceived.', 'All at once Fantine raised her eyes, saw him, and made M.Madeleine turn round.The instant that Madeleine’s glance encountered Javert’s glance,Javert, without stirring, without moving from his post, withoutapproaching him, became terrible.', 'No human sentiment can be as terribleas joy.It was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul.The satisfaction of at last getting hold of Jean Valjean caused allthat was in his soul to appear in his countenance.', 'The depths havingbeen stirred up, mounted to the surface.', 'The humiliation of having, insome slight degree, lost the scent, and of having indulged, for a fewmoments, in an error with regard to Champmathieu, was effaced by prideat having so well and accurately divined in the first place, and ofhaving for so long cherished a just instinct.', 'Javert’s content shoneforth in his sovereign attitude.', 'The deformity of triumph overspreadthat narrow brow.', 'All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfiedface can afford were there.Javert was in heaven at that moment.', 'Without putting the thing clearlyto himself, but with a confused intuition of the necessity of hispresence and of his success, he, Javert, personified justice, light,and truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil.', 'Behind himand around him, at an infinite distance, he had authority, reason, thecase judged, the legal conscience, the public prosecution, all thestars; he was protecting order, he was causing the law to yield up itsthunders, he was avenging society, he was lending a helping hand to theabsolute, he was standing erect in the midst of a glory.', 'There existedin his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat.', 'Erect, haughty,brilliant, he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality ofa ferocious archangel.', 'The terrible shadow of the action which he wasaccomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visiblein his clenched fist; happy and indignant, he held his heel upon crime,vice, rebellion, perdition, hell; he was radiant, he exterminated, hesmiled, and there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous SaintMichael.Javert, though frightful, had nothing ignoble about him.Probity, sincerity, candor, conviction, the sense of duty, are thingswhich may become hideous when wrongly directed; but which, even whenhideous, remain grand: their majesty, the majesty peculiar to the humanconscience, clings to them in the midst of horror; they are virtueswhich have one vice,—error.', 'The honest, pitiless joy of a fanatic inthe full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriouslyvenerable radiance.', 'Without himself suspecting the fact, Javert in hisformidable happiness was to be pitied, as is every ignorant man whotriumphs.', 'Nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face,wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of thegood.CHAPTER IV—AUTHORITY REASSERTS ITS RIGHTSFantine had not seen Javert since the day on which the mayor had tornher from the man.', 'Her ailing brain comprehended nothing, but the onlything which she did not doubt was that he had come to get her.', 'Shecould not endure that terrible face; she felt her life quitting her;she hid her face in both hands, and shrieked in her anguish:—“Monsieur Madeleine, save me!”Jean Valjean—we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise—had risen.He said to Fantine in the gentlest and calmest of voices:—“Be at ease; it is not for you that he is come.”Then he addressed Javert, and said:—“I know what you want.”Javert replied:—“Be quick about it!”There lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these wordssomething indescribably fierce and frenzied.', 'Javert did not say, “Bequick about it!” he said “Bequiabouit.”No orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered:it was no longer a human word: it was a roar.He did not proceed according to his custom, he did not enter into thematter, he exhibited no warrant of arrest.', 'In his eyes, Jean Valjeanwas a sort of mysterious combatant, who was not to be laid hands upon,a wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last fiveyears, without being able to throw him.', 'This arrest was not abeginning, but an end.', 'He confined himself to saying, “Be quick aboutit!”As he spoke thus, he did not advance a single step; he hurled at JeanValjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling-hook, and withwhich he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him.It was this glance which Fantine had felt penetrating to the verymarrow of her bones two months previously.At Javert’s exclamation, Fantine opened her eyes once more.', 'But themayor was there; what had she to fear?Javert advanced to the middle of the room, and cried:—“See here now!', 'Art thou coming?”The unhappy woman glanced about her.', 'No one was present excepting thenun and the mayor.', 'To whom could that abject use of “thou” beaddressed?', 'To her only.', 'She shuddered.Then she beheld a most unprecedented thing, a thing so unprecedentedthat nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackestdeliriums of fever.She beheld Javert, the police spy, seize the mayor by the collar; shesaw the mayor bow his head.', 'It seemed to her that the world was comingto an end.Javert had, in fact, grasped Jean Valjean by the collar.“Monsieur le Maire!” shrieked Fantine.Javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed allhis gums.“There is no longer any Monsieur le Maire here!”Jean Valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped thecollar of his coat.', 'He said:—“Javert—”Javert interrupted him: “Call me Mr. Inspector.”“Monsieur,” said Jean Valjean, “I should like to say a word to you inprivate.”“Aloud!', 'Say it aloud!” replied Javert; “people are in the habit oftalking aloud to me.”Jean Valjean went on in a lower tone:—“I have a request to make of you—”“I tell you to speak loud.”“But you alone should hear it—”“What difference does that make to me?', 'I shall not listen.”Jean Valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very lowvoice:—“Grant me three days’ grace!', 'three days in which to go and fetch thechild of this unhappy woman.', 'I will pay whatever is necessary.', 'Youshall accompany me if you choose.”“You are making sport of me!” cried Javert.', '“Come now, I did not thinkyou such a fool!', 'You ask me to give you three days in which to runaway!', 'You say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature’schild!', 'Ah!', 'Ah!', 'That’s good!', 'That’s really capital!”Fantine was seized with a fit of trembling.“My child!” she cried, “to go and fetch my child!', 'She is not here,then!', 'Answer me, sister; where is Cosette?', 'I want my child!', 'MonsieurMadeleine!', 'Monsieur le Maire!”Javert stamped his foot.“And now there’s the other one!', 'Will you hold your tongue, you hussy?It’s a pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates, and wherewomen of the town are cared for like countesses!', 'Ah!', 'But we are goingto change all that; it is high time!”He stared intently at Fantine, and added, once more taking into hisgrasp Jean Valjean’s cravat, shirt and collar:—“I tell you that there is no Monsieur Madeleine and that there is noMonsieur le Maire.', 'There is a thief, a brigand, a convict named JeanValjean!', 'And I have him in my grasp!', 'That’s what there is!”Fantine raised herself in bed with a bound, supporting herself on herstiffened arms and on both hands: she gazed at Jean Valjean, she gazedat Javert, she gazed at the nun, she opened her mouth as though tospeak; a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat, her teethchattered; she stretched out her arms in her agony, opening her handsconvulsively, and fumbling about her like a drowning person; thensuddenly fell back on her pillow.Her head struck the head-board of the bed and fell forwards on herbreast, with gaping mouth and staring, sightless eyes.She was dead.Jean Valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of Javert, andopened it as he would have opened the hand of a baby; then he said toJavert:—“You have murdered that woman.”“Let’s have an end of this!” shouted Javert, in a fury; “I am not hereto listen to argument.', 'Let us economize all that; the guard is below;march on instantly, or you’ll get the thumb-screws!”In the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead, which was in adecidedly decrepit state, and which served the sisters as a camp-bedwhen they were watching with the sick.', 'Jean Valjean stepped up to thisbed, in a twinkling wrenched off the head-piece, which was already in adilapidated condition, an easy matter to muscles like his, grasped theprincipal rod like a bludgeon, and glanced at Javert.', 'Javert retreatedtowards the door.', 'Jean Valjean, armed with his bar of iron, walkedslowly up to Fantine’s couch.', 'When he arrived there he turned and saidto Javert, in a voice that was barely audible:—“I advise you not to disturb me at this moment.”One thing is certain, and that is, that Javert trembled.It did occur to him to summon the guard, but Jean Valjean might availhimself of that moment to effect his escape; so he remained, graspedhis cane by the small end, and leaned against the door-post, withoutremoving his eyes from Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed, andhis brow on his hand, and began to contemplate the motionless body ofFantine, which lay extended there.', 'He remained thus, mute, absorbed,evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life.Upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressiblepity.', 'After a few moments of this meditation he bent towards Fantine,and spoke to her in a low voice.What did he say to her?', 'What could this man, who was reproved, say tothat woman, who was dead?', 'What words were those?', 'No one on earth heardthem.', 'Did the dead woman hear them?', 'There are some touching illusionswhich are, perhaps, sublime realities.', 'The point as to which thereexists no doubt is, that Sister Simplice, the sole witness of theincident, often said that at the moment that Jean Valjean whispered inFantine’s ear, she distinctly beheld an ineffable smile dawn on thosepale lips, and in those dim eyes, filled with the amazement of thetomb.Jean Valjean took Fantine’s head in both his hands, and arranged it onthe pillow as a mother might have done for her child; then he tied thestring of her chemise, and smoothed her hair back under her cap.', 'Thatdone, he closed her eyes.Fantine’s face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment.Death, that signifies entrance into the great light.Fantine’s hand was hanging over the side of the bed.', 'Jean Valjean kneltdown before that hand, lifted it gently, and kissed it.Then he rose, and turned to Javert.“Now,” said he, “I am at your disposal.”CHAPTER V—A SUITABLE TOMBJavert deposited Jean Valjean in the city prison.The arrest of M. Madeleine occasioned a sensation, or rather, anextraordinary commotion in M. sur M. We are sorry that we cannotconceal the fact, that at the single word, “He was a convict,” nearlyevery one deserted him.', 'In less than two hours all the good that he haddone had been forgotten, and he was nothing but a “convict from thegalleys.” It is just to add that the details of what had taken place atArras were not yet known.', 'All day long conversations like the followingwere to be heard in all quarters of the town:—“You don’t know?', 'He was a liberated convict!” “Who?” “The mayor.” “Bah!M.', 'Madeleine?” “Yes.” “Really?” “His name was not Madeleine at all; hehad a frightful name, Béjean, Bojean, Boujean.” “Ah!', 'Good God!” “He hasbeen arrested.” “Arrested!” “In prison, in the city prison, whilewaiting to be transferred.” “Until he is transferred!” “He is to betransferred!” “Where is he to be taken?” “He will be tried at theAssizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago.” “Well!', 'Isuspected as much.', 'That man was too good, too perfect, too affected.', 'Herefused the cross; he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he cameacross.', 'I always thought there was some evil history back of all that.”The “drawing-rooms” particularly abounded in remarks of this nature.One old lady, a subscriber to the _Drapeau Blanc_, made the followingremark, the depth of which it is impossible to fathom:—“I am not sorry.', 'It will be a lesson to the Bonapartists!”It was thus that the phantom which had been called M. Madeleinevanished from M. sur M. Only three or four persons in all the townremained faithful to his memory.', 'The old portress who had served himwas among the number.On the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in herlodge, still in a thorough fright, and absorbed in sad reflections.', 'Thefactory had been closed all day, the carriage gate was bolted, thestreet was deserted.', 'There was no one in the house but the two nuns,Sister Perpétue and Sister Simplice, who were watching beside the bodyof Fantine.Towards the hour when M. Madeleine was accustomed to return home, thegood portress rose mechanically, took from a drawer the key of M.Madeleine’s chamber, and the flat candlestick which he used everyevening to go up to his quarters; then she hung the key on the nailwhence he was accustomed to take it, and set the candlestick on oneside, as though she was expecting him.', 'Then she sat down again on herchair, and became absorbed in thought once more.', 'The poor, good oldwoman had done all this without being conscious of it.It was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself fromher reverie, and exclaimed, “Hold!', 'My good God Jesus!', 'And I hung hiskey on the nail!”At that moment the small window in the lodge opened, a hand passedthrough, seized the key and the candlestick, and lighted the taper atthe candle which was burning there.The portress raised her eyes, and stood there with gaping mouth, and ashriek which she confined to her throat.She knew that hand, that arm, the sleeve of that coat.It was M. Madeleine.It was several seconds before she could speak; she had a _seizure_, asshe said herself, when she related the adventure afterwards.“Good God, Monsieur le Maire,” she cried at last, “I thought you were—”She stopped; the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking inrespect towards the beginning.', 'Jean Valjean was still Monsieur le Maireto her.He finished her thought.“In prison,” said he.', '“I was there; I broke a bar of one of thewindows; I let myself drop from the top of a roof, and here I am.', 'I amgoing up to my room; go and find Sister Simplice for me.', 'She is withthat poor woman, no doubt.”The old woman obeyed in all haste.He gave her no orders; he was quite sure that she would guard himbetter than he should guard himself.No one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyardwithout opening the big gates.', 'He had, and always carried about him, apass-key which opened a little side-door; but he must have beensearched, and his latch-key must have been taken from him.', 'This pointwas never explained.He ascended the staircase leading to his chamber.', 'On arriving at thetop, he left his candle on the top step of his stairs, opened his doorwith very little noise, went and closed his window and his shutters byfeeling, then returned for his candle and re-entered his room.It was a useful precaution; it will be recollected that his windowcould be seen from the street.He cast a glance about him, at his table, at his chair, at his bedwhich had not been disturbed for three days.', 'No trace of the disorderof the night before last remained.', 'The portress had “done up” his room;only she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table thetwo iron ends of the cudgel and the forty-sou piece which had beenblackened by the fire.He took a sheet of paper, on which he wrote: “These are the two tips ofmy iron-shod cudgel and the forty-sou piece stolen from Little Gervais,which I mentioned at the Court of Assizes,” and he arranged this pieceof paper, the bits of iron, and the coin in such a way that they werethe first things to be seen on entering the room.', 'From a cupboard hepulled out one of his old shirts, which he tore in pieces.', 'In thestrips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks.He betrayed neither haste nor agitation; and while he was wrapping upthe Bishop’s candlesticks, he nibbled at a piece of black bread.', 'It wasprobably the prison-bread which he had carried with him in his flight.This was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the roomwhen the authorities made an examination later on.There came two taps at the door.“Come in,” said he.It was Sister Simplice.She was pale; her eyes were red; the candle which she carried trembledin her hand.', 'The peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is, thathowever polished or cool we may be, they wring human nature from ourvery bowels, and force it to reappear on the surface.', 'The emotions ofthat day had turned the nun into a woman once more.', 'She had wept, andshe was trembling.Jean Valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper, which hehanded to the nun, saying, “Sister, you will give this to Monsieur leCuré.”The paper was not folded.', 'She cast a glance upon it.“You can read it,” said he.She read:—“I beg Monsieur le Curé to keep an eye on all that I leave behind me.He will be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial, and ofthe funeral of the woman who died yesterday.', 'The rest is for the poor.”The sister tried to speak, but she only managed to stammer a fewinarticulate sounds.', 'She succeeded in saying, however:—“Does not Monsieur le Maire desire to take a last look at that poor,unhappy woman?”“No,” said he; “I am pursued; it would only end in their arresting mein that room, and that would disturb her.”He had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on thestaircase.', 'They heard a tumult of ascending footsteps, and the oldportress saying in her loudest and most piercing tones:—“My good sir, I swear to you by the good God, that not a soul hasentered this house all day, nor all the evening, and that I have noteven left the door.”A man responded:—“But there is a light in that room, nevertheless.”They recognized Javert’s voice.The chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the cornerof the wall on the right.', 'Jean Valjean blew out the light and placedhimself in this angle.', 'Sister Simplice fell on her knees near thetable.The door opened.Javert entered.The whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress wereaudible in the corridor.The nun did not raise her eyes.', 'She was praying.The candle was on the chimney-piece, and gave but very little light.Javert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement.It will be remembered that the fundamental point in Javert, hiselement, the very air he breathed, was veneration for all authority.This was impregnable, and admitted of neither objection norrestriction.', 'In his eyes, of course, the ecclesiastical authority wasthe chief of all; he was religious, superficial and correct on thispoint as on all others.', 'In his eyes, a priest was a mind, who nevermakes a mistake; a nun was a creature who never sins; they were soulswalled in from this world, with a single door which never opened exceptto allow the truth to pass through.On perceiving the sister, his first movement was to retire.But there was also another duty which bound him and impelled himimperiously in the opposite direction.', 'His second movement was toremain and to venture on at least one question.This was Sister Simplice, who had never told a lie in her life.', 'Javertknew it, and held her in special veneration in consequence.“Sister,” said he, “are you alone in this room?”A terrible moment ensued, during which the poor portress felt as thoughshe should faint.The sister raised her eyes and answered:—“Yes.”“Then,” resumed Javert, “you will excuse me if I persist; it is myduty; you have not seen a certain person—a man—this evening?', 'He hasescaped; we are in search of him—that Jean Valjean; you have not seenhim?”The sister replied:—“No.”She lied.', 'She had lied twice in succession, one after the other,without hesitation, promptly, as a person does when sacrificingherself.“Pardon me,” said Javert, and he retired with a deep bow.O sainted maid!', 'you left this world many years ago; you have rejoinedyour sisters, the virgins, and your brothers, the angels, in the light;may this lie be counted to your credit in paradise!The sister’s affirmation was for Javert so decisive a thing that he didnot even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just beenextinguished, and which was still smoking on the table.An hour later, a man, marching amid trees and mists, was rapidlydeparting from M. sur M. in the direction of Paris.', 'That man was JeanValjean.', 'It has been established by the testimony of two or threecarters who met him, that he was carrying a bundle; that he was dressedin a blouse.', 'Where had he obtained that blouse?', 'No one ever found out.But an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few daysbefore, leaving behind him nothing but his blouse.', 'Perhaps that was theone.One last word about Fantine.We all have a mother,—the earth.', 'Fantine was given back to that mother.The curé thought that he was doing right, and perhaps he really was, inreserving as much money as possible from what Jean Valjean had left forthe poor.', 'Who was concerned, after all?', 'A convict and a woman of thetown.', 'That is why he had a very simple funeral for Fantine, and reducedit to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper’s grave.So Fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongsto anybody and everybody, and where the poor are lost.', 'Fortunately, Godknows where to find the soul again.', 'Fantine was laid in the shade,among the first bones that came to hand; she was subjected to thepromiscuousness of ashes.', 'She was thrown into the public grave.', 'Hergrave resembled her bed.', '[THE END OF VOLUME I “FANTINE”] EnlargeFrontispiece Volume Two  2frontispiece  EnlargeTitlepage Volume Two  2titlepageVOLUME II—COSETTEBOOK FIRST—WATERLOOCHAPTER I—WHAT IS MET WITH ON THE WAY FROM NIVELLESLast year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the personwho is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles, and directing hiscourse towards La Hulpe.', 'He was on foot.', 'He was pursuing a broad pavedroad, which undulated between two rows of trees, over the hills whichsucceed each other, raise the road and let it fall again, and producesomething in the nature of enormous waves.He had passed Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaac.', 'In the west he perceivedthe slate-roofed tower of Braine-l’Alleud, which has the form of areversed vase.', 'He had just left behind a wood upon an eminence; and atthe angle of the crossroad, by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbetbearing the inscription _Ancient Barrier No.', '4_, a public house,bearing on its front this sign: _At the Four Winds_ (Aux Quatre Vents)._Échabeau, Private Café_.A quarter of a league further on, he arrived at the bottom of a littlevalley, where there is water which passes beneath an arch made throughthe embankment of the road.', 'The clump of sparsely planted but verygreen trees, which fills the valley on one side of the road, isdispersed over the meadows on the other, and disappears gracefully andas in order in the direction of Braine-l’Alleud.On the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cartat the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of driedbrushwood near a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, anda ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions.', 'Ayoung girl was weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster, probablyof some outside spectacle, such as a parish festival, was fluttering inthe wind.', 'At one corner of the inn, beside a pool in which a flotillaof ducks was navigating, a badly paved path plunged into the bushes.The wayfarer struck into this.After traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the fifteenthcentury, surmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks set in contrast, hefound himself before a large door of arched stone, with a rectilinearimpost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked by two flatmedallions.', 'A severe façade rose above this door; a wall, perpendicularto the façade, almost touched the door, and flanked it with an abruptright angle.', 'In the meadow before the door lay three harrows, throughwhich, in disorder, grew all the flowers of May.', 'The door was closed.The two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an oldrusty knocker.The sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering of May,which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind.', 'Abrave little bird, probably a lover, was carolling in a distractedmanner in a large tree.The wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation,resembling the hollow of a sphere, in the stone on the left, at thefoot of the pier of the door.At this moment the leaves of the door parted, and a peasant womanemerged.She saw the wayfarer, and perceived what he was looking at.“It was a French cannon-ball which made that,” she said to him.', 'And sheadded:—“That which you see there, higher up in the door, near a nail, is thehole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg.', 'The bullet did not piercethe wood.”“What is the name of this place?” inquired the wayfarer.“Hougomont,” said the peasant woman.The traveller straightened himself up.', 'He walked on a few paces, andwent off to look over the tops of the hedges.', 'On the horizon throughthe trees, he perceived a sort of little elevation, and on thiselevation something which at that distance resembled a lion.He was on the battle-field of Waterloo.CHAPTER II—HOUGOMONTHougomont,—this was a funereal spot, the beginning of the obstacle, thefirst resistance, which that great wood-cutter of Europe, calledNapoleon, encountered at Waterloo, the first knot under the blows ofhis axe.It was a château; it is no longer anything but a farm.', 'For theantiquary, Hougomont is _Hugomons_.', 'This manor was built by Hugo, Sireof Somerel, the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the Abbey ofVilliers.The traveller pushed open the door, elbowed an ancient calash under theporch, and entered the courtyard.The first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of thesixteenth century, which here simulates an arcade, everything elsehaving fallen prostrate around it.', 'A monumental aspect often has itsbirth in ruin.', 'In a wall near the arcade opens another arched door, ofthe time of Henry IV., permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard;beside this door, a manure-hole, some pickaxes, some shovels, somecarts, an old well, with its flagstone and its iron reel, a chickenjumping, and a turkey spreading its tail, a chapel surmounted by asmall bell-tower, a blossoming pear-tree trained in espalier againstthe wall of the chapel—behold the court, the conquest of which was oneof Napoleon’s dreams.', 'This corner of earth, could he but have seizedit, would, perhaps, have given him the world likewise.', 'Chickens arescattering its dust abroad with their beaks.', 'A growl is audible; it isa huge dog, who shows his teeth and replaces the English.The English behaved admirably there.', 'Cooke’s four companies of guardsthere held out for seven hours against the fury of an army.Hougomont viewed on the map, as a geometrical plan, comprisingbuildings and enclosures, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, oneangle of which is nicked out.', 'It is this angle which contains thesouthern door, guarded by this wall, which commands it only a gun’slength away.', 'Hougomont has two doors,—the southern door, that of thechâteau;

its horror isvisible there; the confusion of the fray was petrified there; it livesand it dies there; it was only yesterday.', 'The walls are in the deathagony, the stones fall; the breaches cry aloud; the holes are wounds;the drooping, quivering trees seem to be making an effort to flee.This courtyard was more built up in 1815 than it is to-day.', 'Buildingswhich have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles.The English barricaded themselves there;

he joined anddissolved battles with cannon.', 'There was something of the sharpshooterin his genius.', 'To beat in squares, to pulverize regiments, to breaklines, to crush and disperse masses,—for him everything lay in this, tostrike, strike, strike incessantly,—and he intrusted this task to thecannon-ball.', 'A redoubtable method, and one which, united with genius,rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for thespace of fifteen years.On the 18th of June, 1815, he relied all the more on his artillery,because he had numbers on his side.', 'Wellington had only one hundred andfifty-nine mouths of fire; Napoleon had two hundred and forty.Suppose the soil dry, and the artillery capable of moving, the actionwould have begun at six o’clock in the morning.', 'The battle would havebeen won and ended at two o’clock, three hours before the change offortune in favor of the Prussians.', 'What amount of blame attaches toNapoleon for the loss of this battle?', 'Is the shipwreck due to thepilot?Was it the evident physical decline of Napoleon that complicated thisepoch by an inward diminution of force?', 'Had the twenty years of warworn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard, the soul as well as thebody?', 'Did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader?', 'Ina word, was this genius, as many historians of note have thought,suffering from an eclipse?', 'Did he go into a frenzy in order to disguisehis weakened powers from himself?', 'Did he begin to waver under thedelusion of a breath of adventure?', 'Had he become—a grave matter in ageneral—unconscious of peril?', 'Is there an age, in this class ofmaterial great men, who may be called the giants of action, when geniusgrows short-sighted?', 'Old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal;for the Dantes and Michael Angelos to grow old is to grow in greatness;is it to grow less for the Hannibals and the Bonapartes?', 'Had Napoleonlost the direct sense of victory?', 'Had he reached the point where hecould no longer recognize the reef, could no longer divine the snare,no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses?', 'Had he lost his powerof scenting out catastrophes?', 'He who had in former days known all theroads to triumph, and who, from the summit of his chariot of lightning,pointed them out with a sovereign finger, had he now reached that stateof sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legionsharnessed to it, to the precipice?', 'Was he seized at the age offorty-six with a supreme madness?', 'Was that titanic charioteer ofdestiny no longer anything more than an immense dare-devil?We do not think so.His plan of battle was, by the confession of all, a masterpiece.', 'To gostraight to the centre of the Allies’ line, to make a breach in theenemy, to cut them in two, to drive the British half back on Hal, andthe Prussian half on Tongres, to make two shattered fragments ofWellington and Blücher, to carry Mont-Saint-Jean, to seize Brussels, tohurl the German into the Rhine, and the Englishman into the sea.', 'Allthis was contained in that battle, according to Napoleon.', 'Afterwardspeople would see.Of course, we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle ofWaterloo; one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we arerelating is connected with this battle, but this history is not oursubject; this history, moreover, has been finished, and finished in amasterly manner, from one point of view by Napoleon, and from anotherpoint of view by a whole pleiad of historians.7As for us, we leave the historians at loggerheads; we are but a distantwitness, a passer-by on the plain, a seeker bending over that soil allmade of human flesh, taking appearances for realities, perchance; wehave no right to oppose, in the name of science, a collection of factswhich contain illusions, no doubt; we possess neither military practicenor strategic ability which authorize a system; in our opinion, a chainof accidents dominated the two leaders at Waterloo; and when it becomesa question of destiny, that mysterious culprit, we judge like thatingenious judge, the populace.CHAPTER IV—AThose persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of Waterloohave only to place, mentally, on the ground, a capital A.', 'The left limbof the A is the road to Nivelles, the right limb is the road toGenappe, the tie of the A is the hollow road to Ohain fromBraine-l’Alleud.', 'The top of the A is Mont-Saint-Jean, where Wellingtonis; the lower left tip is Hougomont, where Reille is stationed withJérôme Bonaparte; the right tip is the Belle-Alliance, where Napoleonwas.', 'At the centre of this chord is the precise point where the finalword of the battle was pronounced.', 'It was there that the lion has beenplaced, the involuntary symbol of the supreme heroism of the ImperialGuard.The triangle included in the top of the A, between the two limbs andthe tie, is the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean.', 'The dispute over thisplateau constituted the whole battle.', 'The wings of the two armiesextended to the right and left of the two roads to Genappe andNivelles; d’Erlon facing Picton, Reille facing Hill.Behind the tip of the A, behind the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, is theforest of Soignes.As for the plain itself, let the reader picture to himself a vastundulating sweep of ground; each rise commands the next rise, and allthe undulations mount towards Mont-Saint-Jean, and there end in theforest.Two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers.', 'It is aquestion of seizing the opponent round the waist.', 'The one seeks to tripup the other.', 'They clutch at everything: a bush is a point of support;an angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder; for the lackof a hovel under whose cover they can draw up, a regiment yields itsground; an unevenness in the ground, a chance turn in the landscape, across-path encountered at the right moment, a grove, a ravine, can staythe heel of that colossus which is called an army, and prevent itsretreat.', 'He who quits the field is beaten; hence the necessitydevolving on the responsible leader, of examining the mostinsignificant clump of trees, and of studying deeply the slightestrelief in the ground.The two generals had attentively studied the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean,now called the plain of Waterloo.', 'In the preceding year, Wellington,with the sagacity of foresight, had examined it as the possible seat ofa great battle.', 'Upon this spot, and for this duel, on the 18th of June,Wellington had the good post, Napoleon the bad post.', 'The English armywas stationed above, the French army below.It is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of Napoleon onhorseback, glass in hand, upon the heights of Rossomme, at daybreak, onJune 18, 1815.', 'All the world has seen him before we can show him.', 'Thatcalm profile under the little three-cornered hat of the school ofBrienne, that green uniform, the white revers concealing the star ofthe Legion of Honor, his great coat hiding his epaulets, the corner ofred ribbon peeping from beneath his vest, his leather trousers, thewhite horse with the saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing on thecorners crowned N’s and eagles, Hessian boots over silk stockings,silver spurs, the sword of Marengo,—that whole figure of the last ofthe Cæsars is present to all imaginations, saluted with acclamations bysome, severely regarded by others.That figure stood for a long time wholly in the light; this arose froma certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes, andwhich always veils the truth for a longer or shorter time; but to-dayhistory and daylight have arrived.That light called history is pitiless; it possesses this peculiar anddivine quality, that, pure light as it is, and precisely because it iswholly light, it often casts a shadow in places where people hadhitherto beheld rays; from the same man it constructs two differentphantoms, and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it, andthe shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader.Hence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations.Babylon violated lessens Alexander, Rome enchained lessens Cæsar,Jerusalem murdered lessens Titus, tyranny follows the tyrant.', 'It is amisfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears hisform.CHAPTER V—THE QUID OBSCURUM OF BATTLESEvery one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle; abeginning which was troubled, uncertain, hesitating, menacing to botharmies, but still more so for the English than for the French.It had rained all night, the earth had been cut up by the downpour, thewater had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as ifin casks; at some points the gear of the artillery carriages was buriedup to the axles, the circingles of the horses were dripping with liquidmud.', 'If the wheat and rye trampled down by this cohort of transports onthe march had not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath thewheels, all movement, particularly in the valleys, in the direction ofPapelotte would have been impossible.The affair began late.', 'Napoleon, as we have already explained, was inthe habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand, like a pistol,aiming it now at one point, now at another, of the battle; and it hadbeen his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallopfreely.', 'In order to do that it was necessary that the sun should comeout and dry the soil.', 'But the sun did not make its appearance.', 'It wasno longer the rendezvous of Austerlitz.', 'When the first cannon wasfired, the English general, Colville, looked at his watch, and notedthat it was thirty-five minutes past eleven.The action was begun furiously, with more fury, perhaps, than theEmperor would have wished, by the left wing of the French resting onHougomont.', 'At the same time Napoleon attacked the centre by hurlingQuiot’s brigade on La Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed forward the rightwing of the French against the left wing of the English, which restedon Papelotte.The attack on Hougomont was something of a feint; the plan was to drawWellington thither, and to make him swerve to the left.', 'This plan wouldhave succeeded if the four companies of the English guards and thebrave Belgians of Perponcher’s division had not held the positionsolidly, and Wellington, instead of massing his troops there, couldconfine himself to despatching thither, as reinforcements, only fourmore companies of guards and one battalion from Brunswick.The attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was calculated,in fact, to overthrow the English left, to cut off the road toBrussels, to bar the passage against possible Prussians, to forceMont-Saint-Jean, to turn Wellington back on Hougomont, thence onBraine-l’Alleud, thence on Hal; nothing easier.', 'With the exception of afew incidents this attack succeeded.', 'Papelotte was taken; LaHaie-Sainte was carried.A detail to be noted.', 'There was in the English infantry, particularlyin Kempt’s brigade, a great many raw recruits.', 'These young soldierswere valiant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry; theirinexperience extricated them intrepidly from the dilemma; theyperformed particularly excellent service as skirmishers: the soldierskirmisher, left somewhat to himself, becomes, so to speak, his owngeneral.', 'These recruits displayed some of the French ingenuity andfury.', 'This novice of an infantry had dash.', 'This displeased Wellington.After the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered.There is in this day an obscure interval, from midday to four o’clock;the middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct, andparticipates in the sombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict.', 'Twilightreigns over it.', 'We perceive vast fluctuations in that fog, a dizzymirage, paraphernalia of war almost unknown to-day, pendant colbacks,floating sabre-taches, cross-belts, cartridge-boxes for grenades,hussar dolmans, red boots with a thousand wrinkles, heavy shakosgarlanded with torsades, the almost black infantry of Brunswick mingledwith the scarlet infantry of England, the English soldiers with great,white circular pads on the slopes of their shoulders for epaulets, theHanoverian light-horse with their oblong casques of leather, with brasshands and red horse-tails, the Scotch with their bare knees and plaids,the great white gaiters of our grenadiers; pictures, not strategiclines—what Salvator Rosa requires, not what is suited to the needs ofGribeauval.A certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle.', '_Quidobscurum, quid divinum_.', 'Each historian traces, to some extent, theparticular feature which pleases him amid this pell-mell.', 'Whatever maybe the combinations of the generals, the shock of armed masses has anincalculable ebb.', 'During the action the plans of the two leaders enterinto each other and become mutually thrown out of shape.', 'Such a pointof the field of battle devours more combatants than such another, justas more or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the waterwhich is poured on them.', 'It becomes necessary to pour out more soldiersthan one would like; a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen.The line of battle waves and undulates like a thread, the trails ofblood gush illogically, the fronts of the armies waver, the regimentsform capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw; all these reefs arecontinually moving in front of each other.', 'Where the infantry stood theartillery arrives, the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was, thebattalions are like smoke.', 'There was something there; seek it.', 'It hasdisappeared; the open spots change place, the sombre folds advance andretreat, a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward, hurls back,distends, and disperses these tragic multitudes.', 'What is a fray?', 'anoscillation?', 'The immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute,not a day.', 'In order to depict a battle, there is required one of thosepowerful painters who have chaos in their brushes.', 'Rembrandt is betterthan Vandermeulen; Vandermeulen, exact at noon, lies at three o’clock.Geometry is deceptive; the hurricane alone is trustworthy.', 'That is whatconfers on Folard the right to contradict Polybius.', 'Let us add, thatthere is a certain instant when the battle degenerates into a combat,becomes specialized, and disperses into innumerable detailed feats,which, to borrow the expression of Napoleon himself, “belong rather tothe biography of the regiments than to the history of the army.” Thehistorian has, in this case, the evident right to sum up the whole.', 'Hecannot do more than seize the principal outlines of the struggle, andit is not given to any one narrator, however conscientious he may be,to fix, absolutely, the form of that horrible cloud which is called abattle.This, which is true of all great armed encounters, is particularlyapplicable to Waterloo.Nevertheless, at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came to apoint.CHAPTER VI—FOUR O’CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOONTowards four o’clock the condition of the English army was serious.', 'ThePrince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing,Picton of the left wing.', 'The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid,shouted to the Hollando-Belgians: “Nassau!', 'Brunswick!', 'Never retreat!”Hill, having been weakened, had come up to the support of Wellington;Picton was dead.', 'At the very moment when the English had captured fromthe French the flag of the 105th of the line, the French had killed theEnglish general, Picton, with a bullet through the head.', 'The battlehad, for Wellington, two bases of action, Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte;Hougomont still held out, but was on fire;

Ponsonby’s great dragoons had been hacked topieces.', 'That valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro andbeneath the cuirassiers of Travers; out of twelve hundred horses, sixhundred remained; out of three lieutenant-colonels, two lay on theearth,—Hamilton wounded, Mater slain.', 'Ponsonby had fallen, riddled byseven lance-thrusts.', 'Gordon was dead.', 'Marsh was dead.', 'Two divisions,the fifth and the sixth, had been annihilated.Hougomont injured, La Haie-Sainte taken, there now existed but onerallying-point, the centre.', 'That point still held firm.', 'Wellingtonreinforced it.', 'He summoned thither Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; hesummoned Chassé, who was at Braine-l’Alleud.The centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, and verycompact, was strongly posted.', 'It occupied the plateau ofMont-Saint-Jean, having behind it the village, and in front of it theslope, which was tolerably steep then.', 'It rested on that stout stonedwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of Nivelles, andwhich marks the intersection of the roads—a pile of the sixteenthcentury, and so robust that the cannon-balls rebounded from it withoutinjuring it.', 'All about the plateau the English had cut the hedges hereand there, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees, thrust the throat ofa cannon between two branches, embattled the shrubs.', 'There artillerywas ambushed in the brushwood.', 'This punic labor, incontestablyauthorized by war, which permits traps, was so well done, that Haxo,who had been despatched by the Emperor at nine o’clock in the morningto reconnoitre the enemy’s batteries, had discovered nothing of it, andhad returned and reported to Napoleon that there were no obstaclesexcept the two barricades which barred the road to Nivelles and toGenappe.', 'It was at the season when the grain is tall; on the edge ofthe plateau a battalion of Kempt’s brigade, the 95th, armed withcarabines, was concealed in the tall wheat.Thus assured and buttressed, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch army waswell posted.', 'The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes,then adjoining the field of battle, and intersected by the ponds ofGroenendael and Boitsfort.', 'An army could not retreat thither withoutdissolving; the regiments would have broken up immediately there.', 'Theartillery would have been lost among the morasses.', 'The retreat,according to many a man versed in the art,—though it is disputed byothers,—would have been a disorganized flight.To this centre, Wellington added one of Chassé‘s brigades taken fromthe right wing, and one of Wincke’s brigades taken from the left wing,plus Clinton’s division.', 'To his English, to the regiments of Halkett,to the brigades of Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, he gave asreinforcements and aids, the infantry of Brunswick, Nassau’scontingent, Kielmansegg’s Hanoverians, and Ompteda’s Germans.', 'Thisplaced twenty-six battalions under his hand.', '_The right wing_, asCharras says, _was thrown back on the centre_.', 'An enormous battery wasmasked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now stands what iscalled the “Museum of Waterloo.” Besides this, Wellington had, behind arise in the ground, Somerset’s Dragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horsestrong.', 'It was the remaining half of the justly celebrated Englishcavalry.', 'Ponsonby destroyed, Somerset remained.The battery, which, if completed, would have been almost a redoubt, wasranged behind a very low garden wall, backed up with a coating of bagsof sand and a large slope of earth.', 'This work was not finished; therehad been no time to make a palisade for it.Wellington, uneasy but impassive, was on horseback, and there remainedthe whole day in the same attitude, a little in advance of the old millof Mont-Saint-Jean, which is still in existence, beneath an elm, whichan Englishman, an enthusiastic vandal, purchased later on for twohundred francs, cut down, and carried off.', 'Wellington was coldlyheroic.', 'The bullets rained about him.', 'His aide-de-camp, Gordon, fell athis side.', 'Lord Hill, pointing to a shell which had burst, said to him:“My lord, what are your orders in case you are killed?” “To do likeme,” replied Wellington.', 'To Clinton he said laconically, “To hold thisspot to the last man.” The day was evidently turning out ill.Wellington shouted to his old companions of Talavera, of Vittoria, ofSalamanca: “Boys, can retreat be thought of?', 'Think of old England!”Towards four o’clock, the English line drew back.', 'Suddenly nothing wasvisible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and thesharpshooters; the rest had disappeared: the regiments, dislodged bythe shells and the French bullets, retreated into the bottom, nowintersected by the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean; aretrograde movement took place, the English front hid itself,Wellington drew back.', '“The beginning of retreat!” cried Napoleon.CHAPTER VII—NAPOLEON IN A GOOD HUMORThe Emperor, though ill and discommoded on horseback by a localtrouble, had never been in a better humor than on that day.', 'Hisimpenetrability had been smiling ever since the morning.', 'On the 18th ofJune, that profound soul masked by marble beamed blindly.', 'The man whohad been gloomy at Austerlitz was gay at Waterloo.', 'The greatestfavorites of destiny make mistakes.', 'Our joys are composed of shadow.The supreme smile is God’s alone._Ridet Cæsar, Pompeius flebit_, said the legionaries of the FulminatrixLegion.', 'Pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion, but it iscertain that Cæsar laughed.', 'While exploring on horseback at one o’clockon the preceding night, in storm and rain, in company with Bertrand,the communes in the neighborhood of Rossomme, satisfied at the sight ofthe long line of the English camp-fires illuminating the whole horizonfrom Frischemont to Braine-l’Alleud, it had seemed to him that fate, towhom he had assigned a day on the field of Waterloo, was exact to theappointment; he stopped his horse, and remained for some timemotionless, gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder; andthis fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterioussaying, “We are in accord.” Napoleon was mistaken.', 'They were no longerin accord.He took not a moment for sleep; every instant of that night was markedby a joy for him.', 'He traversed the line of the principal outposts,halting here and there to talk to the sentinels.', 'At half-past two, nearthe wood of Hougomont, he heard the tread of a column on the march; hethought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part of Wellington.He said: “It is the rear-guard of the English getting under way for thepurpose of decamping.', 'I will take prisoners the six thousand Englishwho have just arrived at Ostend.” He conversed expansively; he regainedthe animation which he had shown at his landing on the first of March,when he pointed out to the Grand-Marshal the enthusiastic peasant ofthe Gulf Juan, and cried, “Well, Bertrand, here is a reinforcementalready!” On the night of the 17th to the 18th of June he ralliedWellington.', '“That little Englishman needs a lesson,” said Napoleon.', 'Therain redoubled in violence; the thunder rolled while the Emperor wasspeaking.At half-past three o’clock in the morning, he lost one illusion;officers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him thatthe enemy was not making any movement.', 'Nothing was stirring; not abivouac-fire had been extinguished; the English army was asleep.', 'Thesilence on earth was profound; the only noise was in the heavens.', 'Atfour o’clock, a peasant was brought in to him by the scouts; thispeasant had served as guide to a brigade of English cavalry, probablyVivian’s brigade, which was on its way to take up a position in thevillage of Ohain, at the extreme left.', 'At five o’clock, two Belgiandeserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment,and that the English army was ready for battle.', '“So much the better!”exclaimed Napoleon.', '“I prefer to overthrow them rather than to drivethem back.”In the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms anangle with the Plancenoit road, had a kitchen table and a peasant’schair brought to him from the farm of Rossomme, seated himself, with atruss of straw for a carpet, and spread out on the table the chart ofthe battle-field, saying to Soult as he did so, “A prettychecker-board.”In consequence of the rains during the night, the transports ofprovisions, embedded in the soft roads, had not been able to arrive bymorning; the soldiers had had no sleep; they were wet and fasting.', 'Thisdid not prevent Napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to Ney, “We haveninety chances out of a hundred.” At eight o’clock the Emperor’sbreakfast was brought to him.', 'He invited many generals to it.', 'Duringbreakfast, it was said that Wellington had been to a ball two nightsbefore, in Brussels, at the Duchess of Richmond’s; and Soult, a roughman of war, with a face of an archbishop, said, “The ball takes placeto-day.” The Emperor jested with Ney, who said, “Wellington will not beso simple as to wait for Your Majesty.” That was his way, however.', '“Hewas fond of jesting,” says Fleury de Chaboulon.', '“A merry humor was atthe foundation of his character,” says Gourgaud.', '“He abounded inpleasantries, which were more peculiar than witty,” says BenjaminConstant.', 'These gayeties of a giant are worthy of insistence.', 'It was hewho called his grenadiers “his grumblers”; he pinched their ears; hepulled their moustaches.', '“The Emperor did nothing but play pranks onus,” is the remark of one of them.', 'During the mysterious trip from theisland of Elba to France, on the 27th of February, on the open sea, theFrench brig of war, _Le Zéphyr_, having encountered the brig_L’Inconstant_, on which Napoleon was concealed, and having asked thenews of Napoleon from _L’Inconstant_, the Emperor, who still wore inhis hat the white and amaranthine cockade sown with bees, which he hadadopted at the isle of Elba, laughingly seized the speaking-trumpet,and answered for himself, “The Emperor is well.” A man who laughs likethat is on familiar terms with events.', 'Napoleon indulged in many fitsof this laughter during the breakfast at Waterloo.', 'After breakfast hemeditated for a quarter of an hour; then two generals seated themselveson the truss of straw, pen in hand and their paper on their knees, andthe Emperor dictated to them the order of battle.At nine o’clock, at the instant when the French army, ranged inechelons and set in motion in five columns, had deployed—the divisionsin two lines, the artillery between the brigades, the music at theirhead; as they beat the march, with rolls on the drums and the blasts oftrumpets, mighty, vast, joyous, a sea of casques, of sabres, and ofbayonets on the horizon, the Emperor was touched, and twice exclaimed,“Magnificent!', 'Magnificent!”Between nine o’clock and half-past ten the whole army, incredible as itmay appear, had taken up its position and ranged itself in six lines,forming, to repeat the Emperor’s expression, “the figure of six V’s.” Afew moments after the formation of the battle-array, in the midst ofthat profound silence, like that which heralds the beginning of astorm, which precedes engagements, the Emperor tapped Haxo on theshoulder, as he beheld the three batteries of twelve-pounders, detachedby his orders from the corps of Erlon, Reille, and Lobau, and destinedto begin the action by taking Mont-Saint-Jean, which was situated atthe intersection of the Nivelles and the Genappe roads, and said tohim, “There are four and twenty handsome maids, General.”Sure of the issue, he encouraged with a smile, as they passed beforehim, the company of sappers of the first corps, which he had appointedto barricade Mont-Saint-Jean as soon as the village should be carried.All this serenity had been traversed by but a single word of haughtypity; perceiving on his left, at a spot where there now stands a largetomb, those admirable Scotch Grays, with their superb horses, massingthemselves, he said, “It is a pity.”Then he mounted his horse, advanced beyond Rossomme, and selected forhis post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right ofthe road from Genappe to Brussels, which was his second station duringthe battle.', 'The third station, the one adopted at seven o’clock in theevening, between La Belle-Alliance and La Haie-Sainte, is formidable;it is a rather elevated knoll, which still exists, and behind which theguard was massed on a slope of the plain.', 'Around this knoll the ballsrebounded from the pavements of the road, up to Napoleon himself.', 'As atBrienne, he had over his head the shriek of the bullets and of theheavy artillery.', 'Mouldy cannon-balls, old sword-blades, and shapelessprojectiles, eaten up with rust, were picked up at the spot where hishorse’s feet stood.', '_Scabra rubigine_.', 'A few years ago, a shell ofsixty pounds, still charged, and with its fuse broken off level withthe bomb, was unearthed.', 'It was at this last post that the Emperor saidto his guide, Lacoste, a hostile and terrified peasant, who wasattached to the saddle of a hussar, and who turned round at everydischarge of canister and tried to hide behind Napoleon: “Fool, it isshameful!', 'You’ll get yourself killed with a ball in the back.” He whowrites these lines has himself found, in the friable soil of thisknoll, on turning over the sand, the remains of the neck of a bomb,disintegrated, by the oxidization of six and forty years, and oldfragments of iron which parted like elder-twigs between the fingers.Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of theplains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington tookplace, are no longer what they were on June 18, 1815.', 'By taking fromthis mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its realrelief has been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer findsher bearings there.', 'It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifyingit.', 'Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later,exclaimed, “They have altered my field of battle!” Where the greatpyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was ahillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, butwhich was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe.The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height ofthe two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road fromGenappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other,the German tomb, is on the right.', 'There is no French tomb.', 'The whole ofthat plain is a sepulchre for France.', 'Thanks to the thousands uponthousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred andfifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference, the plateau ofMont-Saint-Jean is now accessible by an easy slope.', 'On the day ofbattle, particularly on the side of La Haie-Sainte, it was abrupt anddifficult of approach.', 'The slope there is so steep that the Englishcannon could not see the farm, situated in the bottom of the valley,which was the centre of the combat.', 'On the 18th of June, 1815, therains had still farther increased this acclivity, the mud complicatedthe problem of the ascent, and the men not only slipped back, but stuckfast in the mire.', 'Along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of trenchwhose presence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine.What was this trench?', 'Let us explain.', 'Braine-l’Alleud is a Belgianvillage; Ohain is another.', 'These villages, both of them concealed incurves of the landscape, are connected by a road about a league and ahalf in length, which traverses the plain along its undulating level,and often enters and buries itself in the hills like a furrow, whichmakes a ravine of this road in some places.', 'In 1815, as at the presentday, this road cut the crest of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean betweenthe two highways from Genappe and Nivelles; only, it is now on a levelwith the plain; it was then a hollow way.', 'Its two slopes have beenappropriated for the monumental hillock.', 'This road was, and still is, atrench throughout the greater portion of its course; a hollow trench,sometimes a dozen feet in depth, and whose banks, being too steep,crumbled away here and there, particularly in winter, under drivingrains.', 'Accidents happened here.', 'The road was so narrow at theBraine-l’Alleud entrance that a passer-by was crushed by a cart, as isproved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery, and which givesthe name of the dead, _Monsieur Bernard Debrye, Merchant of Brussels_,and the date of the accident, _February, 1637_.8 It was so deep on thetable-land of Mont-Saint-Jean that a peasant, Mathieu Nicaise, wascrushed there, in 1783, by a slide from the slope, as is stated onanother stone cross, the top of which has disappeared in the process ofclearing the ground, but whose overturned pedestal is still visible onthe grassy slope to the left of the highway between La Haie-Sainte andthe farm of Mont-Saint-Jean.On the day of battle, this hollow road whose existence was in no wayindicated, bordering the crest of Mont-Saint-Jean, a trench at thesummit of the escarpment, a rut concealed in the soil, was invisible;that is to say, terrible.CHAPTER VIII—THE EMPEROR PUTS A QUESTION TO THE GUIDE LACOSTESo, on the morning of Waterloo, Napoleon was content.He was right; the plan of battle conceived by him was, as we have seen,really admirable.The battle once begun, its very various changes,—the resistance ofHougomont; the tenacity of La Haie-Sainte; the killing of Bauduin; thedisabling of Foy; the unexpected wall against which Soye’s brigade wasshattered; Guilleminot’s fatal heedlessness when he had neither petardnor powder sacks; the miring of the batteries; the fifteen unescortedpieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by Uxbridge; the small effect of thebombs falling in the English lines, and there embedding themselves inthe rain-soaked soil, and only succeeding in producing volcanoes ofmud, so that the canister was turned into a splash; the uselessness ofPiré‘s demonstration on Braine-l’Alleud; all that cavalry, fifteensquadrons, almost exterminated; the right wing of the English badlyalarmed, the left wing badly cut into; Ney’s strange mistake inmassing, instead of echelonning the four divisions of the first corps;men delivered over to grape-shot, arranged in ranks twenty-seven deepand with a frontage of two hundred; the frightful holes made in thesemasses by the cannon-balls; attacking columns disorganized; theside-battery suddenly unmasked on their flank; Bourgeois, Donzelot, andDurutte compromised; Quiot repulsed; Lieutenant Vieux, that Herculesgraduated at the Polytechnic School, wounded at the moment when he wasbeating in with an axe the door of La Haie-Sainte under the downrightfire of the English barricade which barred the angle of the road fromGenappe to Brussels; Marcognet’s division caught between the infantryand the cavalry, shot down at the very muzzle of the guns amid thegrain by Best and Pack, put to the sword by Ponsonby; his battery ofseven pieces spiked; the Prince of Saxe-Weimar holding and guarding, inspite of the Comte d’Erlon, both Frischemont and Smohain; the flag ofthe 105th taken, the flag of the 45th captured; that black Prussianhussar stopped by runners of the flying column of three hundred lightcavalry on the scout between Wavre and Plancenoit; the alarming thingsthat had been said by prisoners; Grouchy’s delay; fifteen hundred menkilled in the orchard of Hougomont in less than an hour; eighteenhundred men overthrown in a still shorter time about LaHaie-Sainte,—all these stormy incidents passing like the clouds ofbattle before Napoleon, had hardly troubled his gaze and had notovershadowed that face of imperial certainty.', 'Napoleon was accustomedto gaze steadily at war; he never added up the heart-rending details,cipher by cipher; ciphers mattered little to him, provided that theyfurnished the total—victory; he was not alarmed if the beginnings didgo astray, since he thought himself the master and the possessor at theend; he knew how to wait, supposing himself to be out of the question,and he treated destiny as his equal: he seemed to say to fate, Thouwilt not dare.Composed half of light and half of shadow, Napoleon thought himselfprotected in good and tolerated in evil.', 'He had, or thought that hehad, a connivance, one might almost say a complicity, of events in hisfavor, which was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity.Nevertheless, when one has Bérésina, Leipzig, and Fontainebleau behindone, it seems as though one might distrust Waterloo.', 'A mysterious frownbecomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens.At the moment when Wellington retreated, Napoleon shuddered.', 'Hesuddenly beheld the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean cleared, and the vanof the English army disappear.', 'It was rallying, but hiding itself.', 'TheEmperor half rose in his stirrups.', 'The lightning of victory flashedfrom his eyes.Wellington, driven into a corner at the forest of Soignes anddestroyed—that was the definitive conquest of England by France; it wasCrécy, Poitiers, Malplaquet, and Ramillies avenged.', 'The man of Marengowas wiping out Agincourt.So the Emperor, meditating on this terrible turn of fortune, swept hisglass for the last time over all the points of the field of battle.', 'Hisguard, standing behind him with grounded arms, watched him from belowwith a sort of religion.', 'He pondered; he examined the slopes, noted thedeclivities, scrutinized the clumps of trees, the square of rye, thepath; he seemed to be counting each bush.', 'He gazed with some intentnessat the English barricades of the two highways,—two large abatis oftrees, that on the road to Genappe above La Haie-Sainte, armed with twocannon, the only ones out of all the English artillery which commandedthe extremity of the field of battle, and that on the road to Nivelleswhere gleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chassé‘s brigade.', 'Near thisbarricade he observed the old chapel of Saint Nicholas, painted white,which stands at the angle of the crossroad near Braine-l’Alleud; hebent down and spoke in a low voice to the guide Lacoste.', 'The guide madea negative sign with his head, which was probably perfidious.The Emperor straightened himself up and fell to thinking.Wellington had drawn back.All that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing him.Napoleon turning round abruptly, despatched an express at full speed toParis to announce that the battle was won.Napoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts.He had just found his clap of thunder.He gave orders to Milhaud’s cuirassiers to carry the table-land ofMont-Saint-Jean.CHAPTER IX—THE UNEXPECTEDThere were three thousand five hundred of them.', 'They formed a front aquarter of a league in extent.', 'They were giant men, on colossal horses.There were six and twenty squadrons of them; and they had behind themto support them Lefebvre-Desnouettes’s division,—the one hundred andsix picked gendarmes, the light cavalry of the Guard, eleven hundredand ninety-seven men, and the lancers of the guard of eight hundred andeighty lances.', 'They wore casques without horse-tails, and cuirasses ofbeaten iron, with horse-pistols in their holsters, and longsabre-swords.', 'That morning the whole army had admired them, when, atnine o’clock, with braying of trumpets and all the music playing “Letus watch o’er the Safety of the Empire,” they had come in a solidcolumn, with one of their batteries on their flank, another in theircentre, and deployed in two ranks between the roads to Genappe andFrischemont, and taken up their position for battle in that powerfulsecond line, so cleverly arranged by Napoleon, which, having on itsextreme left Kellermann’s cuirassiers and on its extreme rightMilhaud’s cuirassiers, had, so to speak, two wings of iron.Aide-de-camp Bernard carried them the Emperor’s orders.', 'Ney drew hissword and placed himself at their head.', 'The enormous squadrons were setin motion.Then a formidable spectacle was seen.All their cavalry, with upraised swords, standards and trumpets flungto the breeze, formed in columns by divisions, descended, by asimultaneous movement and like one man, with the precision of a brazenbattering-ram which is effecting a breach, the hill of La BelleAlliance, plunged into the terrible depths in which so many men hadalready fallen, disappeared there in the smoke, then emerging from thatshadow, reappeared on the other side of the valley, still compact andin close ranks, mounting at a full trot, through a storm of grape-shotwhich burst upon them, the terrible muddy slope of the table-land ofMont-Saint-Jean.', 'They ascended, grave, threatening, imperturbable; inthe intervals between the musketry and the artillery, their colossaltrampling was audible.', 'Being two divisions, there were two columns ofthem; Wathier’s division held the right, Delort’s division was on theleft.', 'It seemed as though two immense adders of steel were to be seencrawling towards the crest of the table-land.', 'It traversed the battlelike a prodigy.Nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt ofthe Muskowa by the heavy cavalry; Murat was lacking here, but Ney wasagain present.', 'It seemed as though that mass had become a monster andhad but one soul.', 'Each column undulated and swelled like the ring of apolyp.', 'They could be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was renthere and there.', 'A confusion of helmets, of cries, of sabres, a stormyheaving of the cruppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish oftrumpets, a terrible and disciplined tumult; over all, the cuirasseslike the scales on the hydra.These narrations seemed to belong to another age.', 'Something parallel tothis vision appeared, no doubt, in the ancient Orphic epics, which toldof the centaurs, the old hippanthropes, those Titans with human headsand equestrian chests who scaled Olympus at a gallop, horrible,invulnerable, sublime—gods and beasts.Odd numerical coincidence,—twenty-six battalions rode to meettwenty-six battalions.', 'Behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadowof the masked battery, the English infantry, formed into thirteensquares, two battalions to the square, in two lines, with seven in thefirst line, six in the second, the stocks of their guns to theirshoulders, taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing,waited, calm, mute, motionless.', 'They did not see the cuirassiers, andthe cuirassiers did not see them.', 'They listened to the rise of thisflood of men.', 'They heard the swelling noise of three thousand horse,the alternate and symmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot, thejingling of the cuirasses, the clang of the sabres and a sort of grandand savage breathing.', 'There ensued a most terrible silence; then, allat once, a long file of uplifted arms, brandishing sabres, appearedabove the crest, and casques, trumpets, and standards, and threethousand heads with gray moustaches, shouting, “Vive l’Empereur!” Allthis cavalry debouched on the plateau, and it was like the appearanceof an earthquake.All at once, a tragic incident; on the English left, on our right, thehead of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor.', 'Onarriving at the culminating point of the crest, ungovernable, utterlygiven over to fury and their course of extermination of the squares andcannon, the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench,—a trenchbetween them and the English.', 'It was the hollow road of Ohain.It was a terrible moment.', 'The ravine was there, unexpected, yawning,directly under the horses’ feet, two fathoms deep between its doubleslopes; the second file pushed the first into it, and the third pushedon the second; the horses reared and fell backward, landed on theirhaunches, slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing andoverwhelming the riders; and there being no means of retreat,—the wholecolumn being no longer anything more than a projectile,—the force whichhad been acquired to crush the English crushed the French; theinexorable ravine could only yield when filled; horses and ridersrolled there pell-mell, grinding each other, forming but one mass offlesh in this gulf: when this trench was full of living men, the restmarched over them and passed on.', 'Almost a third of Dubois’s brigadefell into that abyss.This began the loss of the battle.A local tradition, which evidently exaggerates matters, says that twothousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow roadof Ohain.', 'This figure probably comprises all the other corpses whichwere flung into this ravine the day after the combat.Let us note in passing that it was Dubois’s sorely tried brigade which,an hour previously, making a charge to one side, had captured the flagof the Lunenburg battalion.Napoleon, before giving the order for this charge of Milhaud’scuirassiers, had scrutinized the ground, but had not been able to seethat hollow road, which did not even form a wrinkle on the surface ofthe plateau.', 'Warned, nevertheless, and put on the alert by the littlewhite chapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelleshighway, he had probably put a question as to the possibility of anobstacle, to the guide Lacoste.', 'The guide had answered No.', 'We mightalmost affirm that Napoleon’s catastrophe originated in that sign of apeasant’s head.Other fatalities were destined to arise.Was it possible that Napoleon should have won that battle?', 'We answerNo.', 'Why?', 'Because of Wellington?', 'Because of Blücher?', 'No.', 'Because of God.Bonaparte victor at Waterloo; that does not come within the law of thenineteenth century.', 'Another series of facts was in preparation, inwhich there was no longer any room for Napoleon.', 'The ill will of eventshad declared itself long before.It was time that this vast man should fall.The excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed thebalance.', 'This individual alone counted for more than a universal group.These plethoras of all human vitality concentrated in a single head;the world mounting to the brain of one man,—this would be mortal tocivilization were it to last.', 'The moment had arrived for theincorruptible and supreme equity to alter its plan.', 'Probably theprinciples and the elements, on which the regular gravitations of themoral, as of the material, world depend, had complained.', 'Smoking blood,over-filled cemeteries, mothers in tears,—these are formidablepleaders.', 'When the earth is suffering from too heavy a burden, thereare mysterious groanings of the shades, to which the abyss lends anear.Napoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had beendecided on.He embarrassed God.Waterloo is not a battle; it is a change of front on the part of theUniverse.CHAPTER X—THE PLATEAU OF MONT-SAINT-JEANThe battery was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine.Sixty cannons and the thirteen squares darted lightning point-blank onthe cuirassiers.', 'The intrepid General Delort made the military saluteto the English battery.The whole of the flying artillery of the English had re-entered thesquares at a gallop.', 'The cuirassiers had not had even the time for ahalt.', 'The disaster of the hollow road had decimated, but notdiscouraged them.', 'They belonged to that class of men who, whendiminished in number, increase in courage.Wathier’s column alone had suffered in the disaster; Delort’s column,which Ney had deflected to the left, as though he had a presentiment ofan ambush, had arrived whole.The cuirassiers hurled themselves on the English squares.At full speed, with bridles loose, swords in their teeth, pistols infist,—such was the attack.There are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man untilthe soldier is changed into a statue, and when all this flesh turnsinto granite.', 'The English battalions, desperately assaulted, did notstir.Then it was terrible.All the faces of the English squares were attacked at once.', 'A frenziedwhirl enveloped them.', 'That cold infantry remained impassive.', 'The firstrank knelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets, the secondranks shot them down; behind the second rank the cannoneers chargedtheir guns, the front of the square parted, permitted the passage of aneruption of grape-shot, and closed again.', 'The cuirassiers replied bycrushing them.', 'Their great horses reared, strode across the ranks,leaped over the bayonets and fell, gigantic, in the midst of these fourliving wells.', 'The cannon-balls ploughed furrows in these cuirassiers;the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares.', 'Files of men disappeared,ground to dust under the horses.', 'The bayonets plunged into the belliesof these centaurs; hence a hideousness of wounds which has probablynever been seen anywhere else.', 'The squares, wasted by this mad cavalry,closed up their ranks without flinching.', 'Inexhaustible in the matter ofgrape-shot, they created explosions in their assailants’ midst.', 'Theform of this combat was monstrous.', 'These squares were no longerbattalions, they were craters; those cuirassiers were no longercavalry, they were a tempest.', 'Each square was a volcano attacked by acloud; lava contended with lightning.The square on the extreme right, the most exposed of all, being in theair, was almost annihilated at the very first shock.', 'lt was formed ofthe 75th regiment of Highlanders.', 'The bagpipe-player in the centredropped his melancholy eyes, filled with the reflections of the forestsand the lakes, in profound inattention, while men were beingexterminated around him, and seated on a drum, with his pibroch underhis arm, played the Highland airs.', 'These Scotchmen died thinking of BenLothian, as did the Greeks recalling Argos.', 'The sword of a cuirassier,which hewed down the bagpipes and the arm which bore it, put an end tothe song by killing the singer.The cuirassiers, relatively few in number, and still further diminishedby the catastrophe of the ravine, had almost the whole English armyagainst them, but they multiplied themselves so that each man of themwas equal to ten.', 'Nevertheless, some Hanoverian battalions yielded.Wellington perceived it, and thought of his cavalry.', 'Had Napoleon atthat same moment thought of his infantry, he would have won the battle.This forgetfulness was his great and fatal mistake.All at once, the cuirassiers, who had been the assailants, foundthemselves assailed.', 'The English cavalry was at their back.', 'Before themtwo squares, behind them Somerset; Somerset meant fourteen hundreddragoons of the guard.', 'On the right, Somerset had Dornberg with theGerman light-horse, and on his left, Trip with the Belgian carabineers;the cuirassiers attacked on the flank and in front, before and in therear, by infantry and cavalry, had to face all sides.', 'What mattered itto them?', 'They were a whirlwind.', 'Their valor was somethingindescribable.In addition to this, they had behind them the battery, which was stillthundering.', 'It was necessary that it should be so, or they could neverhave been wounded in the back.', 'One of their cuirasses, pierced on theshoulder by a ball from a biscayan,9 is in the collection of theWaterloo Museum.For such Frenchmen nothing less than such Englishmen was needed.', 'It wasno longer a hand-to-hand conflict; it was a shadow, a fury, a dizzytransport of souls and courage, a hurricane of lightning swords.', 'In aninstant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eighthundred.', 'Fuller, their lieutenant-colonel, fell dead.', 'Ney rushed upwith the lancers and Lefebvre-Desnouettes’s light-horse.', 'The plateau ofMont-Saint-Jean was captured, recaptured, captured again.', 'Thecuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry; or, to putit more exactly, the whole of that formidable rout collared each otherwithout releasing the other.', 'The squares still held firm.There were a dozen assaults.', 'Ney had four horses killed under him.', 'Halfthe cuirassiers remained on the plateau.', 'This conflict lasted twohours.The English army was profoundly shaken.', 'There is no doubt that, hadthey not been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of thehollow road the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre anddecided the victory.', 'This extraordinary cavalry petrified Clinton, whohad seen Talavera and Badajoz.', 'Wellington, three-quarters vanquished,admired heroically.', 'He said in an undertone, “Sublime!”The cuirassiers annihilated seven squares out of thirteen, took orspiked sixty pieces of ordnance, and captured from the Englishregiments six flags, which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of theGuard bore to the Emperor, in front of the farm of La Belle Alliance.Wellington’s situation had grown worse.', 'This strange battle was like aduel between two raging, wounded men, each of whom, still fighting andstill resisting, is expending all his blood.Which of the two will be the first to fall?The conflict on the plateau continued.What had become of the cuirassiers?', 'No one could have told.', 'One thingis certain, that on the day after the battle, a cuirassier and hishorse were found dead among the woodwork of the scales for vehicles atMont-Saint-Jean, at the very point where the four roads from Nivelles,Genappe, La Hulpe, and Brussels meet and intersect each other.', 'Thishorseman had pierced the English lines.', 'One of the men who picked upthe body still lives at Mont-Saint-Jean.', 'His name is Dehaze.', 'He waseighteen years old at that time.Wellington felt that he was yielding.', 'The crisis was at hand.The cuirassiers had not succeeded, since the centre was not brokenthrough.', 'As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one held it,and in fact it remained, to a great extent, with the English.Wellington held the village and the culminating plain; Ney had only thecrest and the slope.', 'They seemed rooted in that fatal soil on bothsides.But the weakening of the English seemed irremediable.', 'The bleeding ofthat army was horrible.', 'Kempt, on the left wing, demandedreinforcements.', '“There are none,” replied Wellington; “he must lethimself be killed!” Almost at that same moment, a singular coincidencewhich paints the exhaustion of the two armies, Ney demanded infantryfrom Napoleon, and Napoleon exclaimed, “Infantry!', 'Where does he expectme to get it?', 'Does he think I can make it?”Nevertheless, the English army was in the worse case of the two.', 'Thefurious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron andbreasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing.', 'A few menclustered round a flag marked the post of a regiment; such and such abattalion was commanded only by a captain or a lieutenant; Alten’sdivision, already so roughly handled at La Haie-Sainte, was almostdestroyed; the intrepid Belgians of Van Kluze’s brigade strewed therye-fields all along the Nivelles road; hardly anything was left ofthose Dutch grenadiers, who, intermingled with Spaniards in our ranksin 1811, fought against Wellington; and who, in 1815, rallied to theEnglish standard, fought against Napoleon.', 'The loss in officers wasconsiderable.', 'Lord Uxbridge, who had his leg buried on the followingday, had his knee shattered.', 'If, on the French side, in that tussle ofthe cuirassiers, Delort, l’Héritier, Colbert, Dnop, Travers, andBlancard were disabled, on the side of the English there was Altenwounded, Barne wounded, Delancey killed, Van Meeren killed, Omptedakilled, the whole of Wellington’s staff decimated, and England had theworse of it in that bloody scale.', 'The second regiment of foot-guardshad lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains, and three ensigns;the first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost 24 officers and 1,200soldiers; the 79th Highlanders had lost 24 officers wounded, 18officers killed, 450 soldiers killed.', 'The Hanoverian hussars ofCumberland, a whole regiment, with Colonel Hacke at its head, who wasdestined to be tried later on and cashiered, had turned bridle in thepresence of the fray, and had fled to the forest of Soignes, sowingdefeat all the way to Brussels.', 'The transports, ammunition-wagons, thebaggage-wagons, the wagons filled with wounded, on perceiving that theFrench were gaining ground and approaching the forest, rushed headlongthither.', 'The Dutch, mowed down by the French cavalry, cried, “Alarm!”From Vert-Coucou to Groenendael, for a distance of nearly two leaguesin the direction of Brussels, according to the testimony ofeye-witnesses who are still alive, the roads were encumbered withfugitives.', 'This panic was such that it attacked the Prince de Condé atMechlin, and Louis XVIII.', 'at Ghent.', 'With the exception of the feeblereserve echelonned behind the ambulance established at the farm ofMont-Saint-Jean, and of Vivian’s and Vandeleur’s brigades, whichflanked the left wing, Wellington had no cavalry left.', 'A number ofbatteries lay unhorsed.', 'These facts are attested by Siborne; andPringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so far as to say that theAnglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand men.', 'The Iron Dukeremained calm, but his lips blanched.', 'Vincent, the Austriancommissioner, Alava, the Spanish commissioner, who were present at thebattle in the English staff, thought the Duke lost.', 'At five o’clockWellington drew out his watch, and he was heard to murmur thesesinister words, “Blücher, or night!”It was at about that moment that a distant line of bayonets gleamed onthe heights in the direction of Frischemont.Here comes the change of face in this giant drama.CHAPTER XI—A BAD GUIDE TO NAPOLEON; A GOOD GUIDE TO BÜLOWThe painful surprise of Napoleon is well known.', 'Grouchy hoped for,Blücher arriving.', 'Death instead of life.Fate has these turns; the throne of the world was expected; it wasSaint Helena that was seen.If the little shepherd who served as guide to Bülow, Blücher’slieutenant, had advised him to debouch from the forest aboveFrischemont, instead of below Plancenoit, the form of the nineteenthcentury might, perhaps, have been different.', 'Napoleon would have wonthe battle of Waterloo.', 'By any other route than that below Plancenoit,the Prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable forartillery, and Bülow would not have arrived.Now the Prussian general, Muffling, declares that one hour’s delay, andBlücher would not have found Wellington on his feet.', '“The battle waslost.”It was time that Bülow should arrive, as will be seen.', 'He had,moreover, been very much delayed.', 'He had bivouacked at Dion-le-Mont,and had set out at daybreak; but the roads were impassable, and hisdivisions stuck fast in the mire.', 'The ruts were up to the hubs of thecannons.', 'Moreover, he had been obliged to pass the Dyle on the narrowbridge of Wavre; the street leading to the bridge had been fired by theFrench, so the caissons and ammunition-wagons could not pass betweentwo rows of burning houses, and had been obliged to wait until theconflagration was extinguished.', 'It was midday before Bülow’s vanguardhad been able to reach Chapelle-Saint-Lambert.Had the action been begun two hours earlier, it would have been over atfour o’clock, and Blücher would have fallen on the battle won byNapoleon.', 'Such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinitewhich we cannot comprehend.The Emperor had been the first, as early as midday, to descry with hisfield-glass, on the extreme horizon, something which had attracted hisattention.', 'He had said, “I see yonder a cloud, which seems to me to betroops.” Then he asked the Duc de Dalmatie, “Soult, what do you see inthe direction of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert?” The marshal, levelling hisglass, answered, “Four or five thousand men, Sire; evidently Grouchy.”But it remained motionless in the mist.', 'All the glasses of the staffhad studied “the cloud” pointed out by the Emperor.', 'Some said: “It istrees.” The truth is, that the cloud did not move.', 'The Emperor detachedDomon’s division of light cavalry to reconnoitre in that quarter.Bülow had not moved, in fact.', 'His vanguard was very feeble, and couldaccomplish nothing.', 'He was obliged to wait for the body of the armycorps, and he had received orders to concentrate his forces beforeentering into line; but at five o’clock, perceiving Wellington’s peril,Blücher ordered Bülow to attack, and uttered these remarkable words:“We must give air to the English army.”A little later, the divisions of Losthin, Hiller, Hacke, and Rysseldeployed before Lobau’s corps, the cavalry of Prince William of Prussiadebouched from the forest of Paris, Plancenoit was in flames, and thePrussian cannon-balls began to rain even upon the ranks of the guard inreserve behind Napoleon.CHAPTER XII—THE GUARDEvery one knows the rest,—the irruption of a third army;

that he is not digging any holewhatever, but is cutting grass for his cows, and that what had beentaken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which he is carrying on hisback, and whose teeth, thanks to the perspective of evening, seemed tospring from his head.', 'The man returns home and dies within the week.The second way is to watch him, to wait until he has dug his hole,until he has filled it and has gone away; then to run with great speedto the trench, to open it once more and to seize the “treasure” whichthe black man has necessarily placed there.', 'In this case one dieswithin the month.', 'Finally, the last method is not to speak to the blackman, not to look at him, and to flee at the best speed of one’s legs.One then dies within the year.As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences,the second, which at all events, presents some advantages, among othersthat of possessing a treasure, if only for a month, is the one mostgenerally adopted.', 'So bold men, who are tempted by every chance, havequite frequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by theblack man, and tried to rob the devil.', 'The success of the operationappears to be but moderate.', 'At least, if the tradition is to bebelieved, and in particular the two enigmatical lines in barbarousLatin, which an evil Norman monk, a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphonhas left on this subject.', 'This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey ofSaint-Georges de Bocherville, near Rouen, and toads spawn on his grave.Accordingly, enormous efforts are made.', 'Such trenches are ordinarilyextremely deep; a man sweats, digs, toils all night—for it must be doneat night; he wets his shirt, burns out his candle, breaks his mattock,and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole, when he lays his hand onthe “treasure,” what does he find?', 'What is the devil’s treasure?', 'A sou,sometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body,sometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in aportfolio, sometimes nothing.', 'This is what Tryphon’s verses seem toannounce to the indiscreet and curious:—“Fodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca,As, nummas, lapides, cadaver, simulacra, nihilque.”It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn withbullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn, which hasevidently served the devil.', 'Tryphon does not record these two finds,since Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since the devil doesnot appear to have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon’stime, and cards before the time of Charles VI.Moreover, if one plays at cards, one is sure to lose all that onepossesses!', 'and as for the powder in the horn, it possesses the propertyof making your gun burst in your face.Now, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to theprosecuting attorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during hisflight of several days had been prowling around Montfermeil, it wasremarked in that village that a certain old road-laborer, namedBoulatruelle, had “peculiar ways” in the forest.', 'People thereaboutsthought they knew that this Boulatruelle had been in the galleys.', 'Hewas subjected to certain police supervision, and, as he could find worknowhere, the administration employed him at reduced rates as aroad-mender on the crossroad from Gagny to Lagny.This Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by theinhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, too promptin removing his cap to every one, and trembling and smiling in thepresence of the gendarmes,—probably affiliated to robber bands, theysaid; suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall.', 'Theonly thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard.This is what people thought they had noticed:—Of late, Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breakingand care of the road at a very early hour, and to betaking himself tothe forest with his pickaxe.', 'He was encountered towards evening in themost deserted clearings, in the wildest thickets; and he had theappearance of being in search of something, and sometimes he wasdigging holes.', 'The goodwives who passed took him at first forBeelzebub; then they recognized Boulatruelle, and were not in the leastreassured thereby.', 'These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle alively displeasure.', 'It was evident that he sought to hide, and thatthere was some mystery in what he was doing.It was said in the village: “It is clear that the devil has appeared.Boulatruelle has seen him, and is on the search.', 'In sooth, he iscunning enough to pocket Lucifer’s hoard.”The Voltairians added, “Will Boulatruelle catch the devil, or will thedevil catch Boulatruelle?” The old women made a great many signs of thecross.In the meantime, Boulatruelle’s manœuvres in the forest ceased; and heresumed his regular occupation of roadmending; and people gossiped ofsomething else.Some persons, however, were still curious, surmising that in all thisthere was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, but some finewindfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil’sbank-bills, and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret.The most “puzzled” were the schoolmaster and Thénardier, the proprietorof the tavern, who was everybody’s friend, and had not disdained toally himself with Boulatruelle.“He has been in the galleys,” said Thénardier.', '“Eh!', 'Good God!', 'no oneknows who has been there or will be there.”One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the lawwould have instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in theforest, and that the latter would have been forced to speak, and thathe would have been put to the torture in case of need, and thatBoulatruelle would not have resisted the water test, for example.', '“Letus put him to the wine test,” said Thénardier.They made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking.Boulatruelle drank an enormous amount, but said very little.', 'Hecombined with admirable art, and in masterly proportions, the thirst ofa gormandizer with the discretion of a judge.', 'Nevertheless, by dint ofreturning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the fewobscure words which he did allow to escape him, this is what Thénardierand the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out:—One morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak,he had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in theunderbrush, a shovel and a pickaxe, _concealed, as one might say_.However, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel andpick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought nomore about it.', 'But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without beingseen himself, as he was hidden by a large tree, “a person who did notbelong in those parts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew well,” directinghis steps towards the densest part of the wood.', 'Translation byThénardier: _A comrade of the galleys_.', 'Boulatruelle obstinatelyrefused to reveal his name.', 'This person carried a package—somethingsquare, like a large box or a small trunk.', 'Surprise on the part ofBoulatruelle.', 'However, it was only after the expiration of seven oreight minutes that the idea of following that “person” had occurred tohim.', 'But it was too late; the person was already in the thicket, nighthad descended, and Boulatruelle had not been able to catch up with him.Then he had adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of thewoods.', '“It was moonlight.” Two or three hours later, Boulatruelle hadseen this person emerge from the brushwood, carrying no longer thecoffer, but a shovel and pick.', 'Boulatruelle had allowed the person topass, and had not dreamed of accosting him, because he said to himselfthat the other man was three times as strong as he was, and armed witha pickaxe, and that he would probably knock him over the head onrecognizing him, and on perceiving that he was recognized.', 'Touchingeffusion of two old comrades on meeting again.', 'But the shovel and pickhad served as a ray of light to Boulatruelle; he had hastened to thethicket in the morning, and had found neither shovel nor pick.', 'Fromthis he had drawn the inference that this person, once in the forest,had dug a hole with his pick, buried the coffer, and reclosed the holewith his shovel.', 'Now, the coffer was too small to contain a body;therefore it contained money.', 'Hence his researches.', 'Boulatruelle hadexplored, sounded, searched the entire forest and the thicket, and haddug wherever the earth appeared to him to have been recently turned up.In vain.He had “ferreted out” nothing.', 'No one in Montfermeil thought any moreabout it.', 'There were only a few brave gossips, who said, “You may becertain that the mender on the Gagny road did not take all that troublefor nothing; he was sure that the devil had come.”CHAPTER III—THE ANKLE-CHAIN MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CERTAIN PREPARATORYMANIPULATION TO BE THUS BROKEN WITH A BLOW FROM A HAMMERTowards the end of October, in that same year, 1823, the inhabitants ofToulon beheld the entry into their port, after heavy weather, and forthe purpose of repairing some damages, of the ship _Orion_, which wasemployed later at Brest as a school-ship, and which then formed a partof the Mediterranean squadron.This vessel, battered as it was,—for the sea had handled itroughly,—produced a fine effect as it entered the roads.', 'It flew somecolors which procured for it the regulation salute of eleven guns,which it returned, shot for shot; total, twenty-two.', 'It has beencalculated that what with salvos, royal and military politenesses,courteous exchanges of uproar, signals of etiquette, formalities ofroadsteads and citadels, sunrises and sunsets, saluted every day by allfortresses and all ships of war, openings and closings of ports, etc.,the civilized world, discharged all over the earth, in the course offour and twenty hours, one hundred and fifty thousand useless shots.', 'Atsix francs the shot, that comes to nine hundred thousand francs a day,three hundred millions a year, which vanish in smoke.', 'This is a meredetail.', 'All this time the poor were dying of hunger.The year 1823 was what the Restoration called “the epoch of the Spanishwar.”This war contained many events in one, and a quantity of peculiarities.A grand family affair for the house of Bourbon; the branch of Francesuccoring and protecting the branch of Madrid, that is to say,performing an act devolving on the elder; an apparent return to ournational traditions, complicated by servitude and by subjection to thecabinets of the North; M. le Duc d’Angoulême, surnamed by the liberalsheets _the hero of Andujar_, compressing in a triumphal attitude thatwas somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air, the ancient and verypowerful terrorism of the Holy Office at variance with the chimericalterrorism of the liberals; the _sansculottes_ resuscitated, to thegreat terror of dowagers, under the name of _descamisados_; monarchyopposing an obstacle to progress described as anarchy; the theories of’89 roughly interrupted in the sap; a European halt, called to theFrench idea, which was making the tour of the world; beside the son ofFrance as generalissimo, the Prince de Carignan, afterwards CharlesAlbert, enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as avolunteer, with grenadier epaulets of red worsted; the soldiers of theEmpire setting out on a fresh campaign, but aged, saddened, after eightyears of repose, and under the white cockade; the tricolored standardwaved abroad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen, as the white standardhad been thirty years earlier at Coblentz; monks mingled with ourtroops; the spirit of liberty and of novelty brought to its senses bybayonets; principles slaughtered by cannonades; France undoing by herarms that which she had done by her mind; in addition to this, hostileleaders sold, soldiers hesitating, cities besieged by millions; nomilitary perils, and yet possible explosions, as in every mine which issurprised and invaded; but little bloodshed, little honor won, shamefor some, glory for no one.', 'Such was this war, made by the princesdescended from Louis XIV., and conducted by generals who had been underNapoleon.', 'Its sad fate was to recall neither the grand war nor grandpolitics.Some feats of arms were serious; the taking of the Trocadéro, amongothers, was a fine military action; but after all, we repeat, thetrumpets of this war give back a cracked sound, the whole effect wassuspicious; history approves of France for making a difficulty aboutaccepting this false triumph.', 'It seemed evident that certain Spanishofficers charged with resistance yielded too easily; the idea ofcorruption was connected with the victory; it appears as thoughgenerals and not battles had been won, and the conquering soldierreturned humiliated.', 'A debasing war, in short, in which the _Bank ofFrance_ could be read in the folds of the flag.Soldiers of the war of 1808, on whom Saragossa had fallen in formidableruin, frowned in 1823 at the easy surrender of citadels, and began toregret Palafox.', 'It is the nature of France to prefer to haveRostopchine rather than Ballesteros in front of her.From a still more serious point of view, and one which it is alsoproper to insist upon here, this war, which wounded the military spiritof France, enraged the democratic spirit.', 'It was an enterprise ofenthralment.', 'In that campaign, the object of the French soldier, theson of democracy, was the conquest of a yoke for others.', 'A hideouscontradiction.', 'France is made to arouse the soul of nations, not tostifle it.', 'All the revolutions of Europe since 1792 are the FrenchRevolution: liberty darts rays from France.', 'That is a solar fact.', 'Blindis he who will not see!', 'It was Bonaparte who said it.The war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, was then,at the same time, an outrage on the French Revolution.', 'It was Francewho committed this monstrous violence; by foul means, for, with theexception of wars of liberation, everything that armies do is by foulmeans.', 'The words _passive obedience_ indicate this.', 'An army is astrange masterpiece of combination where force results from an enormoussum of impotence.', 'Thus is war, made by humanity against humanity,despite humanity, explained.As for the Bourbons, the war of 1823 was fatal to them.', 'They took itfor a success.', 'They did not perceive the danger that lies in having anidea slain to order.', 'They went astray, in their innocence, to such adegree that they introduced the immense enfeeblement of a crime intotheir establishment as an element of strength.', 'The spirit of the ambushentered into their politics.', '1830 had its germ in 1823.', 'The Spanishcampaign became in their counsels an argument for force and foradventures by right Divine.', 'France, having re-established _el reynetto_ in Spain, might well have re-established the absolute king athome.', 'They fell into the alarming error of taking the obedience of thesoldier for the consent of the nation.', 'Such confidence is the ruin ofthrones.', 'It is not permitted to fall asleep, either in the shadow of amachineel tree, nor in the shadow of an army.Let us return to the ship _Orion_.During the operations of the army commanded by the princegeneralissimo, a squadron had been cruising in the Mediterranean.', 'Wehave just stated that the _Orion_ belonged to this fleet, and thataccidents of the sea had brought it into port at Toulon.The presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it whichattracts and engages a crowd.', 'It is because it is great, and the crowdloves what is great.A ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of thegenius of man with the powers of nature.A ship of the line is composed, at the same time, of the heaviest andthe lightest of possible matter, for it deals at one and the same timewith three forms of substance,—solid, liquid, and fluid,—and it must dobattle with all three.', 'It has eleven claws of iron with which to seizethe granite on the bottom of the sea, and more wings and more antennæthan winged insects, to catch the wind in the clouds.', 'Its breath poursout through its hundred and twenty cannons as through enormoustrumpets, and replies proudly to the thunder.', 'The ocean seeks to leadit astray in the alarming sameness of its billows, but the vessel hasits soul, its compass, which counsels it and always shows it the north.In the blackest nights, its lanterns supply the place of the stars.Thus, against the wind, it has its cordage and its canvas; against thewater, wood; against the rocks, its iron, brass, and lead; against theshadows, its light; against immensity, a needle.If one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which,taken as a whole, constitute the ship of the line, one has only toenter one of the six-story covered construction stocks, in the ports ofBrest or Toulon.', 'The vessels in process of construction are under abell-glass there, as it were.', 'This colossal beam is a yard; that greatcolumn of wood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye canreach is the main-mast.', 'Taking it from its root in the stocks to itstip in the clouds, it is sixty fathoms long, and its diameter at itsbase is three feet.', 'The English main-mast rises to a height of twohundred and seventeen feet above the water-line.', 'The navy of ourfathers employed cables, ours employs chains.', 'The simple pile of chainson a ship of a hundred guns is four feet high, twenty feet in breadth,and eight feet in depth.', 'And how much wood is required to make thisship?', 'Three thousand cubic metres.', 'It is a floating forest.And moreover, let this be borne in mind, it is only a question here ofthe military vessel of forty years ago, of the simple sailing-vessel;steam, then in its infancy, has since added new miracles to thatprodigy which is called a war vessel.', 'At the present time, for example,the mixed vessel with a screw is a surprising machine, propelled bythree thousand square metres of canvas and by an engine of two thousandfive hundred horse-power.Not to mention these new marvels, the ancient vessel of ChristopherColumbus and of De Ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man.', 'It is asinexhaustible in force as is the Infinite in gales; it stores up thewind in its sails, it is precise in the immense vagueness of thebillows, it floats, and it reigns.There comes an hour, nevertheless, when the gale breaks that sixty-footyard like a straw, when the wind bends that mast four hundred feettall, when that anchor, which weighs tens of thousands, is twisted inthe jaws of the waves like a fisherman’s hook in the jaws of a pike,when those monstrous cannons utter plaintive and futile roars, whichthe hurricane bears forth into the void and into night, when all thatpower and all that majesty are engulfed in a power and majesty whichare superior.Every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immensefeebleness it affords men food for thought.', 'Hence in the ports curiouspeople abound around these marvellous machines of war and ofnavigation, without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why.Every day, accordingly, from morning until night, the quays, sluices,and the jetties of the port of Toulon were covered with a multitude ofidlers and loungers, as they say in Paris, whose business consisted instaring at the _Orion_.The _Orion_ was a ship that had been ailing for a long time; in thecourse of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collectedon its keel to such a degree as to deprive it of half its speed; it hadgone into the dry dock the year before this, in order to have thebarnacles scraped off, then it had put to sea again; but this cleaninghad affected the bolts of the keel: in the neighborhood of the BalearicIsles the sides had been strained and had opened; and, as the platingin those days was not of sheet iron, the vessel had sprung a leak.', 'Aviolent equinoctial gale had come up, which had first staved in agrating and a porthole on the larboard side, and damaged theforetop-gallant-shrouds; in consequence of these injuries, the _Orion_had run back to Toulon.It anchored near the Arsenal; it was fully equipped, and repairs werebegun.', 'The hull had received no damage on the starboard, but some ofthe planks had been unnailed here and there, according to custom, topermit of air entering the hold.One morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident.', 'EnlargeThe Ship Orion, an Accident 2b2-1-the-ship-orionThe crew was busy bending the sails; the topman, who had to take theupper corner of the main-top-sail on the starboard, lost his balance;he was seen to waver; the multitude thronging the Arsenal quay uttereda cry; the man’s head overbalanced his body; the man fell around theyard, with his hands outstretched towards the abyss; on his way heseized the footrope, first with one hand, then with the other, andremained hanging from it: the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth; theshock of his fall had imparted to the foot-rope a violent swingingmotion; the man swayed back and forth at the end of that rope, like astone in a sling.It was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance; not one ofthe sailors, all fishermen of the coast, recently levied for theservice, dared to attempt it.', 'In the meantime, the unfortunate topmanwas losing his strength; his anguish could not be discerned on hisface, but his exhaustion was visible in every limb; his arms werecontracted in horrible twitchings; every effort which he made tore-ascend served but to augment the oscillations of the foot-rope; hedid not shout, for fear of exhausting his strength.', 'All were awaitingthe minute when he should release his hold on the rope, and, frominstant to instant, heads were turned aside that his fall might not beseen.', 'There are moments when a bit of rope, a pole, the branch of atree, is life itself, and it is a terrible thing to see a living beingdetach himself from it and fall like a ripe fruit.All at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agilityof a tiger-cat; this man was dressed in red; he was a convict; he worea green cap; he was a life convict.', 'On arriving on a level with thetop, a gust of wind carried away his cap, and allowed a perfectly whitehead to be seen: he was not a young man.A convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had, infact, at the very first instant, hastened to the officer of the watch,and, in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew,while all the sailors were trembling and drawing back, he had asked theofficer’s permission to risk his life to save the topman; at anaffirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted tohis ankle with one blow of a hammer, then he had caught up a rope, andhad dashed into the rigging: no one noticed, at the instant, with whatease that chain had been broken; it was only later on that the incidentwas recalled.In a twinkling he was on the yard; he paused for a few seconds andappeared to be measuring it with his eye; these seconds, during whichthe breeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread, seemedcenturies to those who were looking on.', 'At last, the convict raised hiseyes to heaven and advanced a step: the crowd drew a long breath.', 'Hewas seen to run out along the yard: on arriving at the point, hefastened the rope which he had brought to it, and allowed the other endto hang down, then he began to descend the rope, hand over hand, andthen,—and the anguish was indescribable,—instead of one man suspendedover the gulf, there were two.One would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly, only herethe spider brought life, not death.', 'Ten thousand glances were fastenedon this group; not a cry, not a word; the same tremor contracted everybrow; all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add theslightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men.In the meantime, the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to aposition near the sailor.', 'It was high time; one minute more, and theexhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall intothe abyss.', 'The convict had moored him securely with the cord to whichhe clung with one hand, while he was working with the other.', 'At last,he was seen to climb back on the yard, and to drag the sailor up afterhim; he held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength,then he grasped him in his arms and carried him, walking on the yardhimself to the cap, and from there to the main-top, where he left himin the hands of his comrades.At that moment the crowd broke into applause: old convict-sergeantsamong them wept, and women embraced each other on the quay, and allvoices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage, “Pardon for thatman!”He, in the meantime, had immediately begun to make his descent torejoin his detachment.', 'In order to reach them the more speedily, hedropped into the rigging, and ran along one of the lower yards; alleyes were following him.', 'At a certain moment fear assailed them;whether it was that he was fatigued, or that his head turned, theythought they saw him hesitate and stagger.', 'All at once the crowduttered a loud shout: the convict had fallen into the sea.The fall was perilous.', 'The frigate _Algésiras_ was anchored alongsidethe _Orion_, and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels:it was to be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them.Four men flung themselves hastily into a boat; the crowd cheered themon; anxiety again took possession of all souls; the man had not risento the surface; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple,as though he had fallen into a cask of oil: they sounded, they dived.In vain.', 'The search was continued until the evening: they did not evenfind the body.On the following day the Toulon newspaper printed these lines:—“Nov.', '17, 1823.', 'Yesterday, a convict belonging to the detachment onboard of the _Orion_, on his return from rendering assistance to asailor, fell into the sea and was drowned.', 'The body has not yet beenfound; it is supposed that it is entangled among the piles of theArsenal point: this man was committed under the number 9,430, and hisname was Jean Valjean.”BOOK THIRD—ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE PROMISE MADE TO THE DEAD WOMANCHAPTER I—THE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEILMontfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edgeof that lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne.', 'Atthe present day it is a tolerably large town, ornamented all the yearthrough with plaster villas, and on Sundays with beaming bourgeois.', 'In1823 there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so manywell-satisfied citizens: it was only a village in the forest.', 'Somepleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, to besure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies intwisted iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sortsof varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; butMontfermeil was nonetheless a village.', 'Retired cloth-merchants andrusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet; it was a peacefuland charming place, which was not on the road to anywhere: there peoplelived, and cheaply, that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous andso easy; only, water was rare there, on account of the elevation of theplateau.It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; the end ofthe village towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent pondswhich exist in the woods there.', 'The other end, which surrounds thechurch and which lies in the direction of Chelles, found drinking-wateronly at a little spring half-way down the slope, near the road toChelles, about a quarter of an hour from Montfermeil.Thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water.', 'Thelarge houses, the aristocracy, of which the Thénardier tavern formed apart, paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business ofit, and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise ofsupplying Montfermeil with water; but this good man only worked untilseven o’clock in the evening in summer, and five in winter; and nightonce come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed, he who hadno water to drink went to fetch it for himself or did without it.This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader hasprobably not forgotten,—little Cosette.', 'It will be remembered thatCosette was useful to the Thénardiers in two ways: they made the motherpay them, and they made the child serve them.', 'So when the mother ceasedto pay altogether, the reason for which we have read in precedingchapters, the Thénardiers kept Cosette.', 'She took the place of a servantin their house.', 'In this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water whenit was required.', 'So the child, who was greatly terrified at the idea ofgoing to the spring at night, took great care that water should neverbe lacking in the house.Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil.The beginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snownor frost up to that time.', 'Some mountebanks from Paris had obtainedpermission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal streetof the village, and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection ofthe same tolerance, had constructed their stalls on the Church Square,and even extended them into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader willperhaps remember, the Thénardiers’ hostelry was situated.', 'These peoplefilled the inns and drinking-shops, and communicated to that tranquillittle district a noisy and joyous life.', 'In order to play the part of afaithful historian, we ought even to add that, among the curiositiesdisplayed in the square, there was a menagerie, in which frightfulclowns, clad in rags and coming no one knew whence, exhibited to thepeasants of Montfermeil in 1823 one of those horrible Brazilianvultures, such as our Royal Museum did not possess until 1845, andwhich have a tricolored cockade for an eye.', 'I believe that naturalistscall this bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to the order of theApicides, and to the family of the vultures.', 'Some good old Bonapartistsoldiers, who had retired to the village, went to see this creaturewith great devotion.', 'The mountebanks gave out that the tricoloredcockade was a unique phenomenon made by God expressly for theirmenagerie.On Christmas eve itself, a number of men, carters, and peddlers, wereseated at table, drinking and smoking around four or five candles inthe public room of Thénardier’s hostelry.', 'This room resembled alldrinking-shop rooms,—tables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers;but little light and a great deal of noise.', 'The date of the year 1823was indicated, nevertheless, by two objects which were then fashionablein the bourgeois class: to wit, a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbedtin.', 'The female Thénardier was attending to the supper, which wasroasting in front of a clear fire; her husband was drinking with hiscustomers and talking politics.Besides political conversations which had for their principal subjectsthe Spanish war and M. le Duc d’Angoulême, strictly local parentheses,like the following, were audible amid the uproar:—“About Nanterre and Suresnes the vines have flourished greatly.', 'Whenten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve.', 'They have yielded agreat deal of juice under the press.” “But the grapes cannot be ripe?”“In those parts the grapes should not be ripe; the wine turns oily assoon as spring comes.” “Then it is very thin wine?” “There are winespoorer even than these.', 'The grapes must be gathered while green.” Etc.Or a miller would call out:—“Are we responsible for what is in the sacks?', 'We find in them aquantity of small seed which we cannot sift out, and which we areobliged to send through the mill-stones; there are tares, fennel,vetches, hempseed, fox-tail, and a host of other weeds, not to mentionpebbles, which abound in certain wheat, especially in Breton wheat.', 'Iam not fond of grinding Breton wheat, any more than long-sawyers liketo saw beams with nails in them.', 'You can judge of the bad dust thatmakes in grinding.', 'And then people complain of the flour.', 'They are inthe wrong.', 'The flour is no fault of ours.”In a space between two windows a mower, who was seated at table with alanded proprietor who was fixing on a price for some meadow work to beperformed in the spring, was saying:—“It does no harm to have the grass wet.', 'It cuts better.', 'Dew is a goodthing, sir.', 'It makes no difference with that grass.', 'Your grass is youngand very hard to cut still.', 'It’s terribly tender.', 'It yields before theiron.” Etc.Cosette was in her usual place, seated on the cross-bar of the kitchentable near the chimney.', 'She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust intowooden shoes, and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollenstockings destined for the young Thénardiers.', 'A very young kitten wasplaying about among the chairs.', 'Laughter and chatter were audible inthe adjoining room, from two fresh children’s voices: it was Éponineand Azelma.In the chimney-corner a cat-o’-nine-tails was hanging on a nail.At intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere in thehouse, rang through the noise of the dram-shop.', 'It was a little boy whohad been born to the Thénardiers during one of the precedingwinters,—“she did not know why,” she said, “the result of thecold,”—and who was a little more than three years old.', 'The mother hadnursed him, but she did not love him.', 'When the persistent clamor of thebrat became too annoying, “Your son is squalling,” Thénardier wouldsay; “do go and see what he wants.” “Bah!” the mother would reply, “hebothers me.” And the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark.CHAPTER II—TWO COMPLETE PORTRAITSSo far in this book the Thénardiers have been viewed only in profile;the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple, andconsidering it under all its aspects.Thénardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thénardier wasapproaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; sothat there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of thisThénardier woman, ever since her first appearance,—tall, blond, red,fat, angular, square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we havesaid, to the race of those colossal wild women, who contort themselvesat fairs with paving-stones hanging from their hair.', 'She did everythingabout the house,—made the beds, did the washing, the cooking, andeverything else.', 'Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the serviceof an elephant.', 'Everything trembled at the sound of her voice,—windowpanes, furniture, and people.', 'Her big face, dotted with red blotches,presented the appearance of a skimmer.', 'She had a beard.', 'She was anideal market-porter dressed in woman’s clothes.', 'She swore splendidly;she boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist.Except for the romances which she had read, and which made the affectedlady peep through the ogress at times, in a very queer way, the ideawould never have occurred to any one to say of her, “That is a woman.”This Thénardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on afishwife.', 'When one heard her speak, one said, “That is a gendarme”;when one saw her drink, one said, “That is a carter”; when one saw herhandle Cosette, one said, “That is the hangman.” One of her teethprojected when her face was in repose.Thénardier was a small, thin, pale, angular, bony, feeble man, who hada sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy.', 'His cunning began here;he smiled habitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite toeverybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing.', 'Hehad the glance of a pole-cat and the bearing of a man of letters.', 'Hegreatly resembled the portraits of the Abbé Delille.', 'His coquetryconsisted in drinking with the carters.', 'No one had ever succeeded inrendering him drunk.', 'He smoked a big pipe.', 'He wore a blouse, and underhis blouse an old black coat.', 'He made pretensions to literature and tomaterialism.', 'There were certain names which he often pronounced tosupport whatever things he might be saying,—Voltaire, Raynal, Parny,and, singularly enough, Saint Augustine.', 'He declared that he had “asystem.” In addition, he was a great swindler.', 'A _filousophe_[philosophe], a scientific thief.', 'The species does exist.', 'It will beremembered that he pretended to have served in the army; he was in thehabit of relating with exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the 6th orthe 9th light something or other, at Waterloo, he had alone, and in thepresence of a squadron of death-dealing hussars, covered with his bodyand saved from death, in the midst of the grape-shot, “a general, whohad been dangerously wounded.” Thence arose for his wall the flaringsign, and for his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood, of“the cabaret of the Sergeant of Waterloo.” He was a liberal, a classic,and a Bonapartist.', 'He had subscribed for the Champ d’Asile.', 'It was saidin the village that he had studied for the priesthood.We believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper.This rascal of composite order was, in all probability, some Flemingfrom Lille, in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels,being comfortably astride of both frontiers.', 'As for his prowess atWaterloo, the reader is already acquainted with that.', 'It will beperceived that he exaggerated it a trifle.', 'Ebb and flow, wandering,adventure, was the leven of his existence; a tattered conscienceentails a fragmentary life, and, apparently at the stormy epoch of June18, 1815, Thénardier belonged to that variety of marauding sutlers ofwhich we have spoken, beating about the country, selling to some,stealing from others, and travelling like a family man, with wife andchildren, in a rickety cart, in the rear of troops on the march, withan instinct for always attaching himself to the victorious army.', 'Thiscampaign ended, and having, as he said, “some quibus,” he had come toMontfermeil and set up an inn there.This _quibus_, composed of purses and watches, of gold rings and silvercrosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses, did notamount to a large total, and did not carry this sutler turnedeating-house-keeper very far.Thénardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestureswhich, accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, and by a sign ofthe cross, the seminary.', 'He was a fine talker.', 'He allowed it to bethought that he was an educated man.', 'Nevertheless, the schoolmaster hadnoticed that he pronounced improperly.12He composed the travellers’ tariff card in a superior manner, butpractised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it.Thénardier was cunning, greedy, slothful, and clever.', 'He did notdisdain his servants, which caused his wife to dispense with them.', 'Thisgiantess was jealous.', 'It seemed to her that that thin and yellow littleman must be an object coveted by all.Thénardier, who was, above all, an astute and well-balanced man, was ascamp of a temperate sort.', 'This is the worst species; hypocrisy entersinto it.It is not that Thénardier was not, on occasion, capable of wrath toquite the same degree as his wife; but this was very rare, and at suchtimes, since he was enraged with the human race in general, as he borewithin him a deep furnace of hatred.', 'And since he was one of thosepeople who are continually avenging their wrongs, who accuse everythingthat passes before them of everything which has befallen them, and whoare always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand, as alegitimate grievance, the sum total of the deceptions, thebankruptcies, and the calamities of their lives,—when all this leavenwas stirred up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes, he wasterrible.', 'Woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time!In addition to his other qualities, Thénardier was attentive andpenetrating, silent or talkative, according to circumstances, andalways highly intelligent.', 'He had something of the look of sailors, whoare accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses.Thénardier was a statesman.Every newcomer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight of MadameThénardier, “There is the master of the house.” A mistake.', 'She was noteven the mistress.', 'The husband was both master and mistress.', 'Sheworked; he created.', 'He directed everything by a sort of invisible andconstant magnetic action.', 'A word was sufficient for him, sometimes asign; the mastodon obeyed.', 'Thénardier was a sort of special andsovereign being in Madame Thénardier’s eyes, though she did notthoroughly realize it.', 'She was possessed of virtues after her own kind;if she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with “MonsieurThénardier,”—which was an inadmissible hypothesis, by the way,—shewould not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever.She would never have committed “before strangers” that mistake so oftencommitted by women, and which is called in parliamentary language,“exposing the crown.” Although their concord had only evil as itsresult, there was contemplation in Madame Thénardier’s submission toher husband.', 'That mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the littlefinger of that frail despot.', 'Viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side,this was that grand and universal thing, the adoration of mind bymatter; for certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths ofeternal beauty.', 'There was an unknown quantity about Thénardier; hencethe absolute empire of the man over that woman.', 'At certain moments shebeheld him like a lighted candle; at others she felt him like a claw.This woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except herchildren, and who did not fear any one except her husband.', 'She was amother because she was mammiferous.', 'But her maternity stopped shortwith her daughters, and, as we shall see, did not extend to boys.', 'Theman had but one thought,—how to enrich himself.He did not succeed in this.', 'A theatre worthy of this great talent waslacking.', 'Thénardier was ruining himself at Montfermeil, if ruin ispossible to zero; in Switzerland or in the Pyrenees this pennilessscamp would have become a millionaire; but an inn-keeper must browsewhere fate has hitched him.It will be understood that the word _inn-keeper_ is here employed in arestricted sense, and does not extend to an entire class.In this same year, 1823, Thénardier was burdened with about fifteenhundred francs’ worth of petty debts, and this rendered him anxious.Whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case,Thénardier was one of those men who understand best, with the mostprofundity and in the most modern fashion, that thing which is a virtueamong barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilizedpeoples,—hospitality.', 'Besides, he was an admirable poacher, and quotedfor his skill in shooting.', 'He had a certain cold and tranquil laugh,which was particularly dangerous.His theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes.He had professional aphorisms, which he inserted into his wife’s mind.“The duty of the inn-keeper,” he said to her one day, violently, and ina low voice, “is to sell to the first comer, stews, repose, light,fire, dirty sheets, a servant, lice, and a smile; to stop passers-by,to empty small purses, and to honestly lighten heavy ones; to sheltertravelling families respectfully: to shave the man, to pluck the woman,to pick the child clean; to quote the window open, the window shut, thechimney-corner, the armchair, the chair, the ottoman, the stool, thefeather-bed, the mattress and the truss of straw; to know how much theshadow uses up the mirror, and to put a price on it; and, by fivehundred thousand devils, to make the traveller pay for everything, evenfor the flies which his dog eats!”This man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded—a hideous andterrible team.While the husband pondered and combined, Madame Thénardier thought notof absent creditors, took no heed of yesterday nor of to-morrow, andlived in a fit of anger, all in a minute.Such were these two beings.', 'Cosette was between them, subjected totheir double pressure, like a creature who is at the same time beingground up in a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers.', 'The man and thewoman each had a different method: Cosette was overwhelmed withblows—this was the woman’s; she went barefooted in winter—that was theman’s doing.Cosette ran upstairs and down, washed, swept, rubbed, dusted, ran,fluttered about, panted, moved heavy articles, and weak as she was, didthe coarse work.', 'There was no mercy for her; a fierce mistress andvenomous master.', 'The Thénardier hostelry was like a spider’s web, inwhich Cosette had been caught, and where she lay trembling.', 'The idealof oppression was realized by this sinister household.', 'It was somethinglike the fly serving the spiders.The poor child passively held her peace.What takes place within these souls when they have but just quittedGod, find themselves thus, at the very dawn of life, very small and inthe midst of men all naked!CHAPTER III—MEN MUST HAVE WINE, AND HORSES MUST HAVE WATERFour new travellers had arrived.Cosette was meditating sadly; for, although she was only eight yearsold, she had already suffered so much that she reflected with thelugubrious air of an old woman.', 'Her eye was black in consequence of ablow from Madame Thénardier’s fist, which caused the latter to remarkfrom time to time, “How ugly she is with her fist-blow on her eye!”Cosette was thinking that it was dark, very dark, that the pitchers andcaraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must havebeen filled and that there was no more water in the cistern.She was somewhat reassured because no one in the Thénardierestablishment drank much water.', 'Thirsty people were never lackingthere; but their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug ratherthan to the pitcher.', 'Any one who had asked for a glass of water amongall those glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all thesemen.', 'But there came a moment when the child trembled; Madame Thénardierraised the cover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, thenseized a glass and briskly approached the cistern.', 'She turned thefaucet; the child had raised her head and was following all the woman’smovements.', 'A thin stream of water trickled from the faucet, and halffilled the glass.', '“Well,” said she, “there is no more water!” Amomentary silence ensued.', 'The child did not breathe.“Bah!” resumed Madame Thénardier, examining the half-filled glass,“this will be enough.”Cosette applied herself to her work once more, but for a quarter of anhour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snow-flake.She counted the minutes that passed in this manner, and wished it werethe next morning.From time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street, andexclaimed, “It’s as black as an oven!” or, “One must needs be a cat togo about the streets without a lantern at this hour!” And Cosettetrembled.All at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered, andsaid in a harsh voice:—“My horse has not been watered.”“Yes, it has,” said Madame Thénardier.“I tell you that it has not,” retorted the pedler.Cosette had emerged from under the table.“Oh, yes, sir!” said she, “the horse has had a drink; he drank out of abucket, a whole bucketful, and it was I who took the water to him, andI spoke to him.”It was not true; Cosette lied.“There’s a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house,”exclaimed the pedler.', '“I tell you that he has not been watered, youlittle jade!', 'He has a way of blowing when he has had no water, which Iknow well.”Cosette persisted, and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish,and which was hardly audible:—“And he drank heartily.”“Come,” said the pedler, in a rage, “this won’t do at all, let my horsebe watered, and let that be the end of it!”Cosette crept under the table again.“In truth, that is fair!” said Madame Thénardier, “if the beast has notbeen watered, it must be.”Then glancing about her:—“Well, now!', 'Where’s that other beast?”She bent down and discovered Cosette cowering at the other end of thetable, almost under the drinkers’ feet.“Are you coming?” shrieked Madame Thénardier.Cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hiddenherself.', 'The Thénardier resumed:—“Mademoiselle Dog-lack-name, go and water that horse.”“But, Madame,” said Cosette, feebly, “there is no water.”The Thénardier threw the street door wide open:—“Well, go and get some, then!”Cosette dropped her head, and went for an empty bucket which stood nearthe chimney-corner.This bucket was bigger than she was, and the child could have set downin it at her ease.The Thénardier returned to her stove, and tasted what was in thestewpan, with a wooden spoon, grumbling the while:—“There’s plenty in the spring.', 'There never was such a maliciouscreature as that.', 'I think I should have done better to strain myonions.”Then she rummaged in a drawer which contained sous, pepper, andshallots.“See here, Mam’selle Toad,” she added, “on your way back, you will geta big loaf from the baker.', 'Here’s a fifteen-sou piece.”Cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron; she took the coinwithout saying a word, and put it in that pocket.Then she stood motionless, bucket in hand, the open door before her.She seemed to be waiting for some one to come to her rescue.“Get along with you!” screamed the Thénardier.Cosette went out.', 'The door closed behind her.CHAPTER IV—ENTRANCE ON THE SCENE OF A DOLLThe line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, as thereader will remember, as far as the hostelry of the Thénardiers.', 'Thesebooths were all illuminated, because the citizens would soon pass ontheir way to the midnight mass, with candles burning in paper funnels,which, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the table at theThénardiers’ observed, produced “a magical effect.” In compensation,not a star was visible in the sky.The last of these stalls, established precisely opposite theThénardiers’ door, was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, glass,and magnificent objects of tin.', 'In the first row, and far forwards, themerchant had placed on a background of white napkins, an immense doll,nearly two feet high, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, withgold wheat-ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes.', 'Allthat day, this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of allpassers-by under ten years of age, without a mother being found inMontfermeil sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it toher child.', 'Éponine and Azelma had passed hours in contemplating it, andCosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it istrue.At the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy andovercome as she was, she could not refrain from lifting her eyes tothat wonderful doll, towards _the lady_, as she called it.', 'The poorchild paused in amazement.', 'She had not yet beheld that doll close to.The whole shop seemed a palace to her: the doll was not a doll; it wasa vision.', 'It was joy, splendor, riches, happiness, which appeared in asort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundlyengulfed in gloomy and chilly misery.', 'With the sad and innocentsagacity of childhood, Cosette measured the abyss which separated herfrom that doll.', 'She said to herself that one must be a queen, or atleast a princess, to have a “thing” like that.', 'She gazed at thatbeautiful pink dress, that beautiful smooth hair, and she thought, “Howhappy that doll must be!” She could not take her eyes from thatfantastic stall.', 'The more she looked, the more dazzled she grew.', 'Shethought she was gazing at paradise.', 'There were other dolls behind thelarge one, which seemed to her to be fairies and genii.', 'The merchant,who was pacing back and forth in front of his shop, produced on hersomewhat the effect of being the Eternal Father.In this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with which shewas charged.All at once the Thénardier’s coarse voice recalled her to reality:“What, you silly jade!', 'you have not gone?', 'Wait!', 'I’ll give it to you!', 'Iwant to know what you are doing there!', 'Get along, you little monster!”The Thénardier had cast a glance into the street, and had caught sightof Cosette in her ecstasy.Cosette fled, dragging her pail, and taking the longest strides ofwhich she was capable.CHAPTER V—THE LITTLE ONE ALL ALONEAs the Thénardier hostelry was in that part of the village which isnear the church, it was to the spring in the forest in the direction ofChelles that Cosette was obliged to go for her water.She did not glance at the display of a single other merchant.', 'So longas she was in Boulanger Lane and in the neighborhood of the church, thelighted stalls illuminated the road; but soon the last light from thelast stall vanished.', 'The poor child found herself in the dark.', 'Sheplunged into it.', 'Only, as a certain emotion overcame her, she made asmuch motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walkedalong.', 'This made a noise which afforded her company.The further she went, the denser the darkness became.', 'There was no onein the streets.', 'However, she did encounter a woman, who turned aroundon seeing her, and stood still, muttering between her teeth: “Where canthat child be going?', 'Is it a werewolf child?” Then the woman recognizedCosette.', '“Well,” said she, “it’s the Lark!”In this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and desertedstreets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side ofChelles.', 'So long as she had the houses or even the walls only on bothsides of her path, she proceeded with tolerable boldness.', 'From time totime she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of ashutter—this was light and life; there were people there, and itreassured her.', 'But in proportion as she advanced, her pace slackenedmechanically, as it were.', 'When she had passed the corner of the lasthouse, Cosette paused.', 'It had been hard to advance further than thelast stall; it became impossible to proceed further than the lasthouse.', 'She set her bucket on the ground, thrust her hand into her hair,and began slowly to scratch her head,—a gesture peculiar to childrenwhen terrified and undecided what to do.', 'It was no longer Montfermeil;it was the open fields.', 'Black and desert space was before her.', 'Shegazed in despair at that darkness, where there was no longer any one,where there were beasts, where there were spectres, possibly.', 'She tooka good look, and heard the beasts walking on the grass, and shedistinctly saw spectres moving in the trees.', 'Then she seized her bucketagain; fear had lent her audacity.', '“Bah!” said she; “I will tell himthat there was no more water!” And she resolutely re-enteredMontfermeil.Hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began toscratch her head again.', 'Now it was the Thénardier who appeared to her,with her hideous, hyena mouth, and wrath flashing in her eyes.', 'Thechild cast a melancholy glance before her and behind her.', 'What was sheto do?', 'What was to become of her?', 'Where was she to go?', 'In front of herwas the spectre of the Thénardier; behind her all the phantoms of thenight and of the forest.', 'It was before the Thénardier that sherecoiled.', 'She resumed her path to the spring, and began to run.', 'Sheemerged from the village, she entered the forest at a run, no longerlooking at or listening to anything.', 'She only paused in her course whenher breath failed her; but she did not halt in her advance.', 'She wentstraight before her in desperation.As she ran she felt like crying.The nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely.She no longer thought, she no longer saw.', 'The immensity of night wasfacing this tiny creature.', 'On the one hand, all shadow; on the other,an atom.It was only seven or eight minutes’ walk from the edge of the woods tothe spring.', 'Cosette knew the way, through having gone over it manytimes in daylight.', 'Strange to say, she did not get lost.', 'A remnant ofinstinct guided her vaguely.', 'But she did not turn her eyes either toright or to left, for fear of seeing things in the branches and in thebrushwood.', 'In this manner she reached the spring.It was a narrow, natural basin, hollowed out by the water in a clayeysoil, about two feet deep, surrounded with moss and with those tall,crimped grasses which are called Henry IV.‘s frills, and paved withseveral large stones.', 'A brook ran out of it, with a tranquil littlenoise.Cosette did not take time to breathe.', 'It was very dark, but she was inthe habit of coming to this spring.', 'She felt with her left hand in thedark for a young oak which leaned over the spring, and which usuallyserved to support her, found one of its branches, clung to it, bentdown, and plunged the bucket in the water.', 'She was in a state of suchviolent excitement that her strength was trebled.', 'While thus bent over,she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself intothe spring.', 'The fifteen-sou piece fell into the water.', 'Cosette neithersaw nor heard it fall.', 'She drew out the bucket nearly full, and set iton the grass.That done, she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue.', 'She wouldhave liked to set out again at once, but the effort required to fillthe bucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step.She was forced to sit down.', 'She dropped on the grass, and remainedcrouching there.She shut her eyes; then she opened them again, without knowing why, butbecause she could not do otherwise.', 'The agitated water in the bucketbeside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents.Overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds, which were likemasses of smoke.', 'The tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely overthe child.Jupiter was setting in the depths.The child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star, with whichshe was unfamiliar, and which terrified her.', 'The planet was, in fact,very near the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist whichimparted to it a horrible ruddy hue.', 'The mist, gloomily empurpled,magnified the star.', 'One would have called it a luminous wound.A cold wind was blowing from the plain.', 'The forest was dark, not a leafwas moving; there were none of the vague, fresh gleams of summertide.Great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise.', 'Slender andmisshapen bushes whistled in the clearings.', 'The tall grasses undulatedlike eels under the north wind.', 'The nettles seemed to twist long armsfurnished with claws in search of prey.', 'Some bits of dry heather,tossed by the breeze, flew rapidly by, and had the air of fleeing interror before something which was coming after.', 'On all sides there werelugubrious stretches.The darkness was bewildering.', 'Man requires light.', 'Whoever burieshimself in the opposite of day feels his heart contract.', 'When the eyesees black, the heart sees trouble.', 'In an eclipse in the night, in thesooty opacity, there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts.', 'No onewalks alone in the forest at night without trembling.', 'Shadows andtrees—two formidable densities.', 'A chimerical reality appears in theindistinct depths.', 'The inconceivable is outlined a few paces distantfrom you with a spectral clearness.', 'One beholds floating, either inspace or in one’s own brain, one knows not what vague and intangiblething, like the dreams of sleeping flowers.', 'There are fierce attitudeson the horizon.', 'One inhales the effluvia of the great black void.', 'Oneis afraid to glance behind him, yet desirous of doing so.', 'The cavitiesof night, things grown haggard, taciturn profiles which vanish when oneadvances, obscure dishevelments, irritated tufts, livid pools, thelugubrious reflected in the funereal, the sepulchral immensity ofsilence, unknown but possible beings, bendings of mysterious branches,alarming torsos of trees, long handfuls of quivering plants,—againstall this one has no protection.', 'There is no hardihood which does notshudder and which does not feel the vicinity of anguish.', 'One isconscious of something hideous, as though one’s soul were becomingamalgamated with the darkness.', 'This penetration of the shadows isindescribably sinister in the case of a child.Forests are apocalypses, and the beating of the wings of a tiny soulproduces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault.Without understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious that shewas seized upon by that black enormity of nature; it was no longerterror alone which was gaining possession of her; it was something moreterrible even than terror; she shivered.', 'There are no words to expressthe strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom ofher heart; her eye grew wild; she thought she felt that she should notbe able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow.Then, by a sort of instinct, she began to count aloud, one, two, three,four, and so on up to ten, in order to escape from that singular statewhich she did not understand, but which terrified her, and, when shehad finished, she began again; this restored her to a true perceptionof the things about her.', 'Her hands, which she had wet in drawing thewater, felt cold; she rose; her terror, a natural and unconquerableterror, had returned: she had but one thought now,—to flee at fullspeed through the forest, across the fields to the houses, to thewindows, to the lighted candles.', 'Her glance fell upon the water whichstood before her; such was the fright which the Thénardier inspired inher, that she dared not flee without that bucket of water: she seizedthe handle with both hands; she could hardly lift the pail.In this manner she advanced a dozen paces, but the bucket was full; itwas heavy; she was forced to set it on the ground once more.', 'She tookbreath for an instant, then lifted the handle of the bucket again, andresumed her march, proceeding a little further this time, but again shewas obliged to pause.', 'After some seconds of repose she set out again.She walked bent forward, with drooping head, like an old woman; theweight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms.', 'The ironhandle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands;she was forced to halt from time to time, and each time that she didso, the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs.This took place in the depths of a forest, at night, in winter, farfrom all human sight; she was a child of eight: no one but God saw thatsad thing at the moment.And her mother, no doubt, alas!For there are things that make the dead open their eyes in theirgraves.She panted with a sort of painful rattle; sobs contracted her throat,but she dared not weep, so afraid was she of the Thénardier, even at adistance: it was her custom to imagine the Thénardier always present.However, she could not make much headway in that manner, and she wenton very slowly.', 'In spite of diminishing the length of her stops, and ofwalking as long as possible between them, she reflected with anguishthat it would take her more than an hour to return to Montfermeil inthis manner, and that the Thénardier would beat her.', 'This anguish wasmingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night; she wasworn out with fatigue, and had not yet emerged from the forest.', 'Onarriving near an old chestnut-tree with which she was acquainted, madea last halt, longer than the rest, in order that she might get wellrested; then she summoned up all her strength, picked up her bucketagain, and courageously resumed her march, but the poor littledesperate creature could not refrain from crying, “O my God!', 'my God!”At that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longerweighed anything at all: a hand, which seemed to her enormous, had justseized the handle, and lifted it vigorously.', 'She raised her head.', 'Alarge black form, straight and erect, was walking beside her throughthe darkness; it was a man who had come up behind her, and whoseapproach she had not heard.', 'This man, without uttering a word, hadseized the handle of the bucket which she was carrying.There are instincts for all the encounters of life.The child was not afraid.CHAPTER VI—WHICH POSSIBLY PROVES BOULATRUELLE’S INTELLIGENCEOn the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walked forrather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard del’Hôpital in Paris.', 'This man had the air of a person who is seekinglodgings, and he seemed to halt, by preference, at the most modesthouses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.We shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired a chamber inthat isolated quarter.This man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type ofwhat may be called the well-bred mendicant,—extreme wretchednesscombined with extreme cleanliness.', 'This is a very rare mixture whichinspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feelsfor the man who is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy.', 'Hewore a very old and very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, wornperfectly threadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in theleast eccentric at that epoch; a large waistcoat with pockets of avenerable cut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings ofblack worsted; and thick shoes with copper buckles.', 'He would have beenpronounced a preceptor in some good family, returned from theemigration.', 'He would have been taken for more than sixty years of age,from his perfectly white hair, his wrinkled brow, his livid lips, andhis countenance, where everything breathed depression and weariness oflife.', 'Judging from his firm tread, from the singular vigor whichstamped all his movements, he would have hardly been thought fifty.', 'Thewrinkles on his brow were well placed, and would have disposed in hisfavor any one who observed him attentively.', 'His lip contracted with astrange fold which seemed severe, and which was humble.', 'There was inthe depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity.', 'In hisleft hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief; in hisright he leaned on a sort of a cudgel, cut from some hedge.', 'This stickhad been carefully trimmed, and had an air that was not toothreatening; the most had been made of its knots, and it had received acoral-like head, made from red wax: it was a cudgel, and it seemed tobe a cane.There are but few passers-by on that boulevard, particularly in thewinter.', 'The man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them, but thiswithout any affectation.At that epoch, King Louis XVIII.', 'went nearly every day toChoisy-le-Roi: it was one of his favorite excursions.', 'Towards twoo’clock, almost invariably, the royal carriage and cavalcade was seento pass at full speed along the Boulevard de l’Hôpital.This served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of thequarter who said, “It is two o’clock; there he is returning to theTuileries.”And some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing kingalways creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance ofLouis XVIII.', 'produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris.', 'It wasrapid but majestic.', 'This impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop;as he was not able to walk, he wished to run: that cripple would gladlyhave had himself drawn by the lightning.', 'He passed, pacific and severe,in the midst of naked swords.', 'His massive couch, all covered withgilding, with great branches of lilies painted on the panels, thunderednoisily along.', 'There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it.', 'In therear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of whitesatin a large, firm, and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered _àl’oiseau royal_, a proud, hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educatedman, two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeoiscoat, the Golden Fleece, the cross of Saint Louis, the cross of theLegion of Honor, the silver plaque of the Saint-Esprit, a huge belly,and a wide blue ribbon: it was the king.', 'Outside of Paris, he held hishat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in highEnglish gaiters; when he re-entered the city, he put on his hat andsaluted rarely; he stared coldly at the people, and they returned it inkind.', 'When he appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter,the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of aninhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, “That big fellow yonder isthe government.”This infallible passage of the king at the same hour was, therefore,the daily event of the Boulevard de l’Hôpital.The promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in thequarter, and probably did not belong in Paris, for he was ignorant asto this detail.', 'When, at two o’clock, the royal carriage, surrounded bya squadron of the body-guard all covered with silver lace, debouched onthe boulevard, after having made the turn of the Salpêtrière, heappeared surprised and almost alarmed.', 'There was no one but himself inthis cross-lane.', 'He drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of anenclosure, though this did not prevent M. le Duc de Havré from spyinghim out.M.', 'le Duc de Havré, as captain of the guard on duty that day, wasseated in the carriage, opposite the king.', 'He said to his Majesty,“Yonder is an evil-looking man.” Members of the police, who wereclearing the king’s route, took equal note of him: one of them receivedan order to follow him.', 'But the man plunged into the deserted littlestreets of the faubourg, and as twilight was beginning to fall, theagent lost trace of him, as is stated in a report addressed that sameevening to M. le Comte d’Anglès, Minister of State, Prefect of Police.When the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track, heredoubled his pace, not without turning round many a time to assurehimself that he was not being followed.', 'At a quarter-past four, that isto say, when night was fully come, he passed in front of the theatre ofthe Porte Saint-Martin, where _The Two Convicts_ was being played thatday.', 'This poster, illuminated by the theatre lanterns, struck him; for,although he was walking rapidly, he halted to read it.', 'An instant laterhe was in the blind alley of La Planchette, and he entered the _Platd’Etain_ [the Pewter Platter], where the office of the coach for Lagnywas then situated.', 'This coach set out at half-past four.', 'The horseswere harnessed, and the travellers, summoned by the coachman, werehastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle.The man inquired:—“Have you a place?”“Only one—beside me on the box,” said the coachman.“I will take it.”“Climb up.”Nevertheless, before setting out, the coachman cast a glance at thetraveller’s shabby dress, at the diminutive size of his bundle, andmade him pay his fare.“Are you going as far as Lagny?” demanded the coachman.“Yes,” said the man.The traveller paid to Lagny.They started.', 'When they had passed the barrier, the coachman tried toenter into conversation, but the traveller only replied inmonosyllables.', 'The coachman took to whistling and swearing at hishorses.The coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak.', 'It was cold.', 'The man didnot appear to be thinking of that.', 'Thus they passed Gournay andNeuilly-sur-Marne.Towards six o’clock in the evening they reached Chelles.', 'The coachmandrew up in front of the carters’ inn installed in the ancient buildingsof the Royal Abbey, to give his horses a breathing spell.“I get down here,” said the man.He took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle.An instant later he had disappeared.He did not enter the inn.When the coach set out for Lagny a few minutes later, it did notencounter him in the principal street of Chelles.The coachman turned to the inside travellers.“There,” said he, “is a man who does not belong here, for I do not knowhim.', 'He had not the air of owning a sou, but he does not considermoney; he pays to Lagny, and he goes only as far as Chelles.', 'It isnight; all the houses are shut; he does not enter the inn, and he isnot to be found.', 'So he has dived through the earth.”The man had not plunged into the earth, but he had gone with greatstrides through the dark, down the principal street of Chelles, then hehad turned to the right before reaching the church, into the crossroadleading to Montfermeil, like a person who was acquainted with thecountry and had been there before.He followed this road rapidly.', 'At the spot where it is intersected bythe ancient tree-bordered road which runs from Gagny to Lagny, he heardpeople coming.', 'He concealed himself precipitately in a ditch, and therewaited until the passers-by were at a distance.', 'The precaution wasnearly superfluous, however; for, as we have already said, it was avery dark December night.', 'Not more than two or three stars were visiblein the sky.It is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins.', 'The man did notreturn to the road to Montfermeil; he struck across the fields to theright, and entered the forest with long strides.Once in the forest he slackened his pace, and began a carefulexamination of all the trees, advancing, step by step, as thoughseeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone.', 'Therecame a moment when he appeared to lose himself, and he paused inindecision.', 'At last he arrived, by dint of feeling his way inch byinch, at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones.', 'Hestepped up briskly to these stones, and examined them attentivelythrough the mists of night, as though he were passing them in review.', 'Alarge tree, covered with those excrescences which are the warts ofvegetation, stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones.', 'He wentup to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk, asthough seeking to recognize and count all the warts.Opposite this tree, which was an ash, there was a chestnut-tree,suffering from a peeling of the bark, to which a band of zinc had beennailed by way of dressing.', 'He raised himself on tiptoe and touched thisband of zinc.Then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the spacebetween the tree and the heap of stones, like a person who is trying toassure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed.That done, he took his bearings, and resumed his march through theforest.It was the man who had just met Cosette.As he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil, hehad espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan, depositing a burden onthe ground, then taking it up and setting out again.', 'He drew near, andperceived that it was a very young child, laden with an enormous bucketof water.', 'Then he approached the child, and silently grasped the handleof the bucket.CHAPTER VII—COSETTE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE STRANGER IN THE DARKCosette, as we have said, was not frightened.The man accosted her.', 'He spoke in a voice that was grave and almostbass.“My child, what you are carrying is very heavy for you.”Cosette raised her head and replied:—“Yes, sir.”“Give it to me,” said the man; “I will carry it for you.”Cosette let go of the bucket-handle.', 'The man walked along beside her.“It really is very heavy,” he muttered between his teeth.', 'Then headded:—“How old are you, little one?”“Eight, sir.”“And have you come from far like this?”“From the spring in the forest.”“Are you going far?”“A good quarter of an hour’s walk from here.”The man said nothing for a moment; then he remarked abruptly:—“So you have no mother.”“I don’t know,” answered the child.Before the man had time to speak again, she added:—“I don’t think so.', 'Other people have mothers.', 'I have none.”And after a silence she went on:—“I think that I never had any.”The man halted; he set the bucket on the ground, bent down and placedboth hands on the child’s shoulders, making an effort to look at herand to see her face in the dark.Cosette’s thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid lightin the sky.“What is your name?” said the man.“Cosette.”The man seemed to have received an electric shock.', 'He looked at heronce more; then he removed his hands from Cosette’s shoulders, seizedthe bucket, and set out again.After a moment he inquired:—“Where do you live, little one?”“At Montfermeil, if you know where that is.”“That is where we are going?”“Yes, sir.”He paused; then began again:—“Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?”“It was Madame Thénardier.”The man resumed, in a voice which he strove to render indifferent, butin which there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:—“What does your Madame Thénardier do?”“She is my mistress,” said the child.', '“She keeps the inn.”“The inn?” said the man.', '“Well, I am going to lodge there to-night.Show me the way.”“We are on the way there,” said the child.The man walked tolerably fast.', 'Cosette followed him without difficulty.She no longer felt any fatigue.', 'From time to time she raised her eyestowards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribableconfidence.', 'She had never been taught to turn to Providence and topray; nevertheless, she felt within her something which resembled hopeand joy, and which mounted towards heaven.Several minutes elapsed.', 'The man resumed:—“Is there no servant in Madame Thénardier’s house?”“No, sir.”“Are you alone there?”“Yes, sir.”Another pause ensued.', 'Cosette lifted up her voice:—“That is to say, there are two little girls.”“What little girls?”“Ponine and Zelma.”This was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to thefemale Thénardier.“Who are Ponine and Zelma?”“They are Madame Thénardier’s young ladies; her daughters, as you wouldsay.”“And what do those girls do?”“Oh!” said the child, “they have beautiful dolls; things with gold inthem, all full of affairs.', 'They play; they amuse themselves.”“All day long?”“Yes, sir.”“And you?”“I?', 'I work.”“All day long?”The child raised her great eyes, in which hung a tear, which was notvisible because of the darkness, and replied gently:—“Yes, sir.”After an interval of silence she went on:—“Sometimes, when I have finished my work and they let me, I amusemyself, too.”“How do you amuse yourself?”“In the best way I can.', 'They let me alone; but I have not manyplaythings.', 'Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls.', 'Ihave only a little lead sword, no longer than that.”The child held up her tiny finger.“And it will not cut?”“Yes, sir,” said the child; “it cuts salad and the heads of flies.”They reached the village.', 'Cosette guided the stranger through thestreets.', 'They passed the bakeshop, but Cosette did not think of thebread which she had been ordered to fetch.', 'The man had ceased to plyher with questions, and now preserved a gloomy silence.When they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving allthe open-air booths, asked Cosette:—“So there is a fair going on here?”“No, sir; it is Christmas.”As they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:—“Monsieur?”“What, my child?”“We are quite near the house.”“Well?”“Will you let me take my bucket now?”“Why?”“If Madame sees that some one has carried it for me, she will beat me.”The man handed her the bucket.', 'An instant later they were at the taverndoor.CHAPTER VIII—THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF RECEIVING INTO ONE’S HOUSE A POORMAN WHO MAY BE A RICH MANCosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the bigdoll, which was still displayed at the toy-merchant’s; then sheknocked.', 'The door opened.', 'The Thénardier appeared with a candle in herhand.“Ah!', 'so it’s you, you little wretch!', 'good mercy, but you’ve taken yourtime!', 'The hussy has been amusing herself!”“Madame,” said Cosette, trembling all over, “here’s a gentleman whowants a lodging.”The Thénardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace,a change of aspect common to tavern-keepers, and eagerly sought thenewcomer with her eyes.“This is the gentleman?” said she.“Yes, Madame,” replied the man, raising his hand to his hat.Wealthy travellers are not so polite.', 'This gesture, and an inspectionof the stranger’s costume and baggage, which the Thénardier passed inreview with one glance, caused the amiable grimace to vanish, and thegruff mien to reappear.', 'She resumed dryly:—“Enter, my good man.”The “good man” entered.', 'The Thénardier cast a second glance at him,paid particular attention to his frock-coat, which was absolutelythreadbare, and to his hat, which was a little battered, and, tossingher head, wrinkling her nose, and screwing up her eyes, she consultedher husband, who was still drinking with the carters.', 'The husbandreplied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger, which, backedup by an inflation of the lips, signifies in such cases: A regularbeggar.', 'Thereupon, the Thénardier exclaimed:—“Ah!', 'see here, my good man; I am very sorry, but I have no room left.”“Put me where you like,” said the man; “in the attic, in the stable.', 'Iwill pay as though I occupied a room.”“Forty sous.”“Forty sous; agreed.”“Very well, then!”“Forty sous!” said a carter, in a low tone, to the Thénardier woman;“why, the charge is only twenty sous!”“It is forty in his case,” retorted the Thénardier, in the same tone.“I don’t lodge poor folks for less.”“That’s true,” added her husband, gently; “it ruins a house to havesuch people in it.”In the meantime, the man, laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench,had seated himself at a table, on which Cosette made haste to place abottle of wine and a glass.', 'The merchant who had demanded the bucket ofwater took it to his horse himself.', 'Cosette resumed her place under thekitchen table, and her knitting.The man, who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he hadpoured out for himself, observed the child with peculiar attention.Cosette was ugly.', 'If she had been happy, she might have been pretty.', 'Wehave already given a sketch of that sombre little figure.', 'Cosette wasthin and pale; she was nearly eight years old, but she seemed to behardly six.', 'Her large eyes, sunken in a sort of shadow, were almost putout with weeping.', 'The corners of her mouth had that curve of habitualanguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people.Her hands were, as her mother had divined, “ruined with chilblains.”The fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief allthe angles of her bones, and rendered her thinness frightfullyapparent.', 'As she was always shivering, she had acquired the habit ofpressing her knees one against the other.', 'Her entire clothing was but arag which would have inspired pity in summer, and which inspired horrorin winter.', 'All she had on was hole-ridden linen, not a scrap ofwoollen.', 'Her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black andblue spots could be descried, which marked the places where theThénardier woman had touched her.', 'Her naked legs were thin and red.', 'Thehollows in her neck were enough to make one weep.', 'This child’s wholeperson, her mien, her attitude, the sound of her voice, the intervalswhich she allowed to elapse between one word and the next, her glance,her silence, her slightest gesture, expressed and betrayed one soleidea,—fear.Fear was diffused all over her; she was covered with it, so to speak;fear drew her elbows close to her hips, withdrew her heels under herpetticoat, made her occupy as little space as possible, allowed heronly the breath that was absolutely necessary, and had become whatmight be called the habit of her body, admitting of no possiblevariation except an increase.', 'In the depths of her eyes there was anastonished nook where terror lurked.Her fear was such, that on her arrival, wet as she was, Cosette did notdare to approach the fire and dry herself, but sat silently down to herwork again.The expression in the glance of that child of eight years washabitually so gloomy, and at times so tragic, that it seemed at certainmoments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or ademon.As we have stated, she had never known what it is to pray; she hadnever set foot in a church.', '“Have I the time?” said the Thénardier.The man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette.All at once, the Thénardier exclaimed:—“By the way, where’s that bread?”Cosette, according to her custom whenever the Thénardier uplifted hervoice, emerged with great haste from beneath the table.She had completely forgotten the bread.', 'She had recourse to theexpedient of children who live in a constant state of fear.', 'She lied.“Madame, the baker’s shop was shut.”“You should have knocked.”“I did knock, Madame.”“Well?”“He did not open the door.”“I’ll find out to-morrow whether that is true,” said the Thénardier;“and if you are telling me a lie, I’ll lead you a pretty dance.', 'In themeantime, give me back my fifteen-sou piece.”Cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, and turnedgreen.', 'The fifteen-sou piece was not there.“Ah, come now,” said Madame Thénardier, “did you hear me?”Cosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing in it.', 'Whatcould have become of that money?', 'The unhappy little creature could notfind a word to say.', 'She was petrified.“Have you lost that fifteen-sou piece?” screamed the Thénardier,hoarsely, “or do you want to rob me of it?”At the same time, she stretched out her arm towards thecat-o’-nine-tails which hung on a nail in the chimney-corner.This formidable gesture restored to Cosette sufficient strength toshriek:—“Mercy, Madame, Madame!', 'I will not do so any more!”The Thénardier took down the whip.In the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in thefob of his waistcoat, without any one having noticed his movements.Besides, the other travellers were drinking or playing cards, and werenot paying attention to anything.Cosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within the angleof the chimney, endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half-nudelimbs.', 'The Thénardier raised her arm.“Pardon me, Madame,” said the man, “but just now I caught sight ofsomething which had fallen from this little one’s apron pocket, androlled aside.', 'Perhaps this is it.”At the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floorfor a moment.“Exactly; here it is,” he went on, straightening himself up.And he held out a silver coin to the Thénardier.“Yes, that’s it,” said she.It was not it, for it was a twenty-sou piece; but the Thénardier foundit to her advantage.', 'She put the coin in her pocket, and confinedherself to casting a fierce glance at the child, accompanied with theremark, “Don’t let this ever happen again!”Cosette returned to what the Thénardier called “her kennel,” and herlarge eyes, which were riveted on the traveller, began to take on anexpression such as they had never worn before.', 'Thus far it was only aninnocent amazement, but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled withit.“By the way, would you like some supper?” the Thénardier inquired ofthe traveller.He made no reply.', 'He appeared to be absorbed in thought.“What sort of a man is that?” she muttered between her teeth.', '“He’ssome frightfully poor wretch.', 'He hasn’t a sou to pay for a supper.', 'Willhe even pay me for his lodging?', 'It’s very lucky, all the same, that itdid not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor.”In the meantime, a door had opened, and Éponine and Azelma entered.They were two really pretty little girls, more bourgeois than peasantin looks, and very charming; the one with shining chestnut tresses, theother with long black braids hanging down her back, both vivacious,neat, plump, rosy, and healthy, and a delight to the eye.', 'They werewarmly clad, but with so much maternal art that the thickness of thestuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement.', 'There was ahint of winter, though the springtime was not wholly effaced.', 'Lightemanated from these two little beings.', 'Besides this, they were on thethrone.', 'In their toilettes, in their gayety, in the noise which theymade, there was sovereignty.', 'When they entered, the Thénardier said tothem in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration, “Ah!', 'there youare, you children!”Then drawing them, one after the other to her knees, smoothing theirhair, tying their ribbons afresh, and then releasing them with thatgentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers, sheexclaimed, “What frights they are!”They went and seated themselves in the chimney-corner.', 'They had a doll,which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyouschatter.', 'From time to time Cosette raised her eyes from her knitting,and watched their play with a melancholy air.Éponine and Azelma did not look at Cosette.', 'She was the same as a dogto them.', 'These three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twentyyears between them, but they already represented the whole society ofman; envy on the one side, disdain on the other.The doll of the Thénardier sisters was very much faded, very old, andmuch broken; but it seemed nonetheless admirable to Cosette, who hadnever had a doll in her life, _a real doll_, to make use of theexpression which all children will understand.All at once, the Thénardier, who had been going back and forth in theroom, perceived that Cosette’s mind was distracted, and that, insteadof working, she was paying attention to the little ones at their play.“Ah!', 'I’ve caught you at it!” she cried.', '“So that’s the way you work!I’ll make you work to the tune of the whip; that I will.”The stranger turned to the Thénardier, without quitting his chair.“Bah, Madame,” he said, with an almost timid air, “let her play!”Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of muttonand had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper, and who hadnot the air of being frightfully poor, would have been equivalent to anorder.', 'But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such adesire, and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have awill, was something which Madame Thénardier did not intend to tolerate.She retorted with acrimony:—“She must work, since she eats.', 'I don’t feed her to do nothing.”“What is she making?” went on the stranger, in a gentle voice whichcontrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter’sshoulders.The Thénardier deigned to reply:—“Stockings, if you please.', 'Stockings for my little girls, who havenone, so to speak, and who are absolutely barefoot just now.”The man looked at Cosette’s poor little red feet, and continued:—“When will she have finished this pair of stockings?”“She has at least three or four good days’ work on them still, the lazycreature!”“And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she hasfinished them?”The Thénardier cast a glance of disdain on him.“Thirty sous at least.”“Will you sell them for five francs?” went on the man.“Good heavens!” exclaimed a carter who was listening, with a loudlaugh; “five francs!', 'the deuce, I should think so!', 'five balls!”Thénardier thought it time to strike in.“Yes, sir; if such is your fancy, you will be allowed to have that pairof stockings for five francs.', 'We can refuse nothing to travellers.”“You must pay on the spot,” said the Thénardier, in her curt andperemptory fashion.“I will buy that pair of stockings,” replied the man, “and,” he added,drawing a five-franc piece from his pocket, and laying it on the table,“I will pay for them.”Then he turned to Cosette.“Now I own your work; play, my child.”The carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece, that heabandoned his glass and hastened up.“But it’s true!” he cried, examining it.', '“A real hind wheel!', 'and notcounterfeit!”Thénardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket.The Thénardier had no reply to make.', 'She bit her lips, and her faceassumed an expression of hatred.In the meantime, Cosette was trembling.', 'She ventured to ask:—“Is it true, Madame?', 'May I play?”“Play!” said the Thénardier, in a terrible voice.“Thanks, Madame,” said Cosette.And while her mouth thanked the Thénardier, her whole little soulthanked the traveller.Thénardier had resumed his drinking; his wife whispered in his ear:—“Who can this yellow man be?”“I have seen millionaires with coats like that,” replied Thénardier, ina sovereign manner.Cosette had dropped her knitting, but had not left her seat.', 'Cosettealways moved as little as possible.', 'She picked up some old rags and herlittle lead sword from a box behind her.Éponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on.', 'They hadjust executed a very important operation; they had just got hold of thecat.', 'They had thrown their doll on the ground, and Éponine, who was theelder, was swathing the little cat, in spite of its mewing and itscontortions, in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps.', 'Whileperforming this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sisterin that sweet and adorable language of children, whose grace, like thesplendor of the butterfly’s wing, vanishes when one essays to fix itfast.“You see, sister, this doll is more amusing than the other.', 'She twists,she cries, she is warm.', 'See, sister, let us play with her.', 'She shall bemy little girl.', 'I will be a lady.', 'I will come to see you, and you shalllook at her.', 'Gradually, you will perceive her whiskers, and that willsurprise you.', 'And then you will see her ears, and then you will see hertail and it will amaze you.', 'And you will say to me, ‘Ah!', 'Mon Dieu!’ andI will say to you: ‘Yes, Madame, it is my little girl.', 'Little girls aremade like that just at present.’”Azelma listened admiringly to Éponine.In the meantime, the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song, and tolaugh at it until the ceiling shook.', 'Thénardier accompanied andencouraged them.As birds make nests out of everything, so children make a doll out ofanything which comes to hand.', 'While Éponine and Azelma were bundling upthe cat, Cosette, on her side, had dressed up her sword.', 'That done, shelaid it in her arms, and sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep.The doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same time, oneof the most charming instincts of feminine childhood.', 'To care for, toclothe, to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, to teach, scold alittle, to rock, to dandle, to lull to sleep, to imagine that somethingis some one,—therein lies the whole woman’s future.', 'While dreaming andchattering, making tiny outfits, and baby clothes, while sewing littlegowns, and corsages and bodices, the child grows into a young girl, theyoung girl into a big girl, the big girl into a woman.', 'The first childis the continuation of the last doll.A little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy, and quite asimpossible, as a woman without children.So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword.Madame Thénardier approached _the yellow man_; “My husband is right,”she thought; “perhaps it is M. Laffitte; there are such queer richmen!”She came and set her elbows on the table.“Monsieur,” said she.', 'At this word, _Monsieur_, the man turned; up tothat time, the Thénardier had addressed him only as _brave homme_ or_bonhomme_.“You see, sir,” she pursued, assuming a sweetish air that was even morerepulsive to behold than her fierce mien, “I am willing that the childshould play; I do not oppose it, but it is good for once, because youare generous.', 'You see, she has nothing; she must needs work.”“Then this child is not yours?” demanded the man.“Oh!', 'mon Dieu!', 'no, sir!', 'she is a little beggar whom we have taken inthrough charity; a sort of imbecile child.', 'She must have water on thebrain; she has a large head, as you see.', 'We do what we can for her, forwe are not rich; we have written in vain to her native place, and havereceived no reply these six months.', 'It must be that her mother isdead.”“Ah!” said the man, and fell into his reverie once more.“Her mother didn’t amount to much,” added the Thénardier; “sheabandoned her child.”During the whole of this conversation Cosette, as though warned by someinstinct that she was under discussion, had not taken her eyes from theThénardier’s face; she listened vaguely; she caught a few words hereand there.Meanwhile, the drinkers, all three-quarters intoxicated, were repeatingtheir unclean refrain with redoubled gayety; it was a highly spiced andwanton song, in which the Virgin and the infant Jesus were introduced.The Thénardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter.Cosette, from her post under the table, gazed at the fire, which wasreflected from her fixed eyes.', 'She had begun to rock the sort of babywhich she had made, and, as she rocked it, she sang in a low voice, “Mymother is dead!', 'my mother is dead!', 'my mother is dead!”On being urged afresh by the hostess, the yellow man, “themillionaire,” consented at last to take supper.“What does Monsieur wish?”“Bread and cheese,” said the man.“Decidedly, he is a beggar” thought Madame Thénardier.The drunken men were still singing their song, and the child under thetable was singing hers.All at once, Cosette paused; she had just turned round and caught sightof the little Thénardiers’ doll, which they had abandoned for the catand had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table.Then she dropped the swaddled sword, which only half met her needs, andcast her eyes slowly round the room.', 'Madame Thénardier was whisperingto her husband and counting over some money; Ponine and Zelma wereplaying with the cat; the travellers were eating or drinking orsinging; not a glance was fixed on her.', 'She had not a moment to lose;she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees, made sureonce more that no one was watching her; then she slipped quickly up tothe doll and seized it.', 'An instant later she was in her place again,seated motionless, and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the dollwhich she held in her arms.', 'The happiness of playing with a doll was sorare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness.No one had seen her, except the traveller, who was slowly devouring hismeagre supper.This joy lasted about a quarter of an hour.But with all the precautions that Cosette had taken she did notperceive that one of the doll’s legs stuck out and that the fire on thehearth lighted it up very vividly.', 'That pink and shining foot,projecting from the shadow, suddenly struck the eye of Azelma, who saidto Éponine, “Look!', 'sister.”The two little girls paused in stupefaction; Cosette had dared to taketheir doll!Éponine rose, and, without releasing the cat, she ran to her mother,and began to tug at her skirt.“Let me alone!” said her mother; “what do you want?”“Mother,” said the child, “look there!”And she pointed to Cosette.Cosette, absorbed in the ecstasies of possession, no longer saw orheard anything.Madame Thénardier’s countenance assumed that peculiar expression whichis composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life, and whichhas caused this style of woman to be named _Megaeras_.On this occasion, wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further.Cosette had overstepped all bounds; Cosette had laid violent hands onthe doll belonging to “these young ladies.” A czarina who should see amuzhik trying on her imperial son’s blue ribbon would wear no otherface.She shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation:—“Cosette!”Cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her; sheturned round.“Cosette!” repeated the Thénardier.Cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort ofveneration, mingled with despair; then, without taking her eyes fromit, she clasped her hands, and, what is terrible to relate of a childof that age, she wrung them; then—not one of the emotions of the day,neither the trip to the forest, nor the weight of the bucket of water,nor the loss of the money, nor the sight of the whip, nor even the sadwords which she had heard Madame Thénardier utter had been able towring this from her—she wept; she burst out sobbing.Meanwhile, the traveller had risen to his feet.“What is the matter?” he said to the Thénardier.“Don’t you see?” said the Thénardier, pointing to the _corpus delicti_which lay at Cosette’s feet.“Well, what of it?” resumed the man.“That beggar,” replied the Thénardier, “has permitted herself to touchthe children’s doll!”“All this noise for that!” said the man; “well, what if she did playwith that doll?”“She touched it with her dirty hands!” pursued the Thénardier, “withher frightful hands!”Here Cosette redoubled her sobs.“Will you stop your noise?” screamed the Thénardier.The man went straight to the street door, opened it, and stepped out.As soon as he had gone, the Thénardier profited by his absence to giveCosette a hearty kick under the table, which made the child utter loudcries.The door opened again, the man reappeared; he carried in both hands thefabulous doll which we have mentioned, and which all the village bratshad been staring at ever since the morning, and he set it upright infront of Cosette, saying:—“Here; this is for you.”It must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which hehad spent there he had taken confused notice through his reverie ofthat toy shop, lighted up by fire-pots and candles so splendidly thatit was visible like an illumination through the window of thedrinking-shop.Cosette raised her eyes; she gazed at the man approaching her with thatdoll as she might have gazed at the sun; she heard the unprecedentedwords, “It is for you”; she stared at him; she stared at the doll; thenshe slowly retreated, and hid herself at the extreme end, under thetable in a corner of the wall.She no longer cried; she no longer wept; she had the appearance of nolonger daring to breathe.The Thénardier, Éponine, and Azelma were like statues also; the verydrinkers had paused; a solemn silence reigned through the whole room.Madame Thénardier, petrified and mute, recommenced her conjectures:“Who is that old fellow?', 'Is he a poor man?', 'Is he a millionaire?', 'Perhapshe is both; that is to say, a thief.”The face of the male Thénardier presented that expressive fold whichaccentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinctappears there in all its bestial force.', 'The tavern-keeper staredalternately at the doll and at the traveller; he seemed to be scentingout the man, as he would have scented out a bag of money.', 'This did notlast longer than the space of a flash of lightning.', 'He stepped up tohis wife and said to her in a low voice:—“That machine costs at least thirty francs.', 'No nonsense.', 'Down on yourbelly before that man!”Gross natures have this in common with _naïve_ natures, that theypossess no transition state.“Well, Cosette,” said the Thénardier, in a voice that strove to besweet, and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women,“aren’t you going to take your doll?”Cosette ventured to emerge from her hole.“The gentleman has given you a doll, my little Cosette,” saidThénardier, with a caressing air.', '“Take it; it is yours.”Cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror.', 'Her face wasstill flooded with tears, but her eyes began to fill, like the sky atdaybreak, with strange beams of joy.', 'What she felt at that moment was alittle like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told,“Little one, you are the Queen of France.”It seemed to her that if she touched that doll, lightning would dartfrom it.This was true, up to a certain point, for she said to herself that theThénardier would scold and beat her.Nevertheless, the attraction carried the day.', 'She ended by drawing nearand murmuring timidly as she turned towards Madame Thénardier:—“May I, Madame?”No words can render that air, at once despairing, terrified, andecstatic.“Pardi!” cried the Thénardier, “it is yours.', 'The gentleman has given itto you.”“Truly, sir?” said Cosette.', '“Is it true?', 'Is the ‘lady’ mine?”The stranger’s eyes seemed to be full of tears.', 'He appeared to havereached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lesthe should weep.', 'He nodded to Cosette, and placed the “lady’s” hand inher tiny hand.Cosette hastily withdrew her hand, as though that of the “lady”scorched her, and began to stare at the floor.', 'We are forced to addthat at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately.', 'All at onceshe wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport.“I shall call her Catherine,” she said.It was an odd moment when Cosette’s rags met and clasped the ribbonsand fresh pink muslins of the doll.“Madame,” she resumed, “may I put her on a chair?”“Yes, my child,” replied the Thénardier.It was now the turn of Éponine and Azelma to gaze at Cosette with envy.Cosette placed Catherine on a chair, then seated herself on the floorin front of her, and remained motionless, without uttering a word, inan attitude of contemplation.“Play, Cosette,” said the stranger.“Oh!', 'I am playing,” returned the child.This stranger, this unknown individual, who had the air of a visitwhich Providence was making on Cosette, was the person whom theThénardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment.However, it was necessary to control herself.', 'Habituated as she was todissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all hisactions, these emotions were more than she could endure.', 'She made hasteto send her daughters to bed, then she asked the man’s _permission_ tosend Cosette off also; “for she has worked hard all day,” she addedwith a maternal air.', 'Cosette went off to bed, carrying Catherine in herarms.From time to time the Thénardier went to the other end of the roomwhere her husband was, to _relieve her soul_, as she said.', 'Sheexchanged with her husband words which were all the more furiousbecause she dared not utter them aloud.“Old beast!', 'What has he got in his belly, to come and upset us in thismanner!', 'To want that little monster to play!', 'to give away forty-francdolls to a jade that I would sell for forty sous, so I would!', 'A littlemore and he will be saying _Your Majesty_ to her, as though to theDuchesse de Berry!', 'Is there any sense in it?', 'Is he mad, then, thatmysterious old fellow?”“Why!', 'it is perfectly simple,” replied Thénardier, “if that amuses him!It amuses you to have the little one work; it amuses him to have herplay.', 'He’s all right.', 'A traveller can do what he pleases when he paysfor it.', 'If the old fellow is a philanthropist, what is that to you?', 'Ifhe is an imbecile, it does not concern you.', 'What are you worrying for,so long as he has money?”The language of a master, and the reasoning of an innkeeper, neither ofwhich admitted of any reply.The man had placed his elbows on the table, and resumed his thoughtfulattitude.', 'All the other travellers, both pedlers and carters, hadwithdrawn a little, and had ceased singing.', 'They were staring at himfrom a distance, with a sort of respectful awe.', 'This poorly dressedman, who drew “hind-wheels” from his pocket with so much ease, and wholavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes, wascertainly a magnificent fellow, and one to be feared.Many hours passed.', 'The midnight mass was over, the chimes had ceased,the drinkers had taken their departure, the drinking-shop was closed,the public room was deserted, the fire extinct, the stranger stillremained in the same place and the same attitude.', 'From time to time hechanged the elbow on which he leaned.', 'That was all; but he had not saida word since Cosette had left the room.The Thénardiers alone, out of politeness and curiosity, had remained inthe room.“Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?” grumbled theThénardier.', 'When two o’clock in the morning struck, she declaredherself vanquished, and said to her husband, “I’m going to bed.', 'Do asyou like.” Her husband seated himself at a table in the corner, lighteda candle, and began to read the _Courrier Français_.A good hour passed thus.', 'The worthy inn-keeper had perused the_Courrier Français_ at least three times, from the date of the numberto the printer’s name.', 'The stranger did not stir.Thénardier fidgeted, coughed, spit, blew his nose, and creaked hischair.', 'Not a movement on the man’s part.', '“Is he asleep?” thoughtThénardier.', 'The man was not asleep, but nothing could arouse him.At last Thénardier took off his cap, stepped gently up to him, andventured to say:—“Is not Monsieur going to his repose?”_Not going to bed_ would have seemed to him excessive and familiar.', '_Torepose_ smacked of luxury and respect.', 'These words possess themysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the followingday.', 'A chamber where one _sleeps_ costs twenty sous; a chamber in whichone _reposes_ costs twenty francs.“Well!” said the stranger, “you are right.', 'Where is your stable?”“Sir!” exclaimed Thénardier, with a smile, “I will conduct you, sir.”He took the candle; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, andThénardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, which was ofrare splendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a low bedstead,curtained with red calico.“What is this?” said the traveller.“It is really our bridal chamber,” said the tavern-keeper.', '“My wife andI occupy another.', 'This is only entered three or four times a year.”“I should have liked the stable quite as well,” said the man, abruptly.Thénardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark.He lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on thechimney-piece.', 'A very good fire was flickering on the hearth.On the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman’s head-dressin silver wire and orange flowers.“And what is this?” resumed the stranger.“That, sir,” said Thénardier, “is my wife’s wedding bonnet.”The traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say,“There really was a time, then, when that monster was a maiden?”Thénardier lied, however.', 'When he had leased this paltry building forthe purpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamberdecorated in just this manner, and had purchased the furniture andobtained the orange flowers at second hand, with the idea that thiswould cast a graceful shadow on “his spouse,” and would result in whatthe English call respectability for his house.When the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared.', 'Thénardierhad withdrawn discreetly, without venturing to wish him a good night,as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom heproposed to fleece royally the following morning.The inn-keeper retired to his room.', 'His wife was in bed, but she wasnot asleep.', 'When she heard her husband’s step she turned over and saidto him:—“Do you know, I’m going to turn Cosette out of doors to-morrow.”Thénardier replied coldly:—“How you do go on!”They exchanged no further words, and a few moments later their candlewas extinguished.As for the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in acorner.', 'The landlord once gone, he threw himself into an armchair andremained for some time buried in thought.', 'Then he removed his shoes,took one of the two candles, blew out the other, opened the door, andquitted the room, gazing about him like a person who is in search ofsomething.', 'He traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase.', 'There heheard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child.', 'Hefollowed this sound, and came to a sort of triangular recess builtunder the staircase, or rather formed by the staircase itself.', 'Thisrecess was nothing else than the space under the steps.', 'There, in themidst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds, among dust and spiders’webs, was a bed—if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet sofull of holes as to display the straw, and a coverlet so tattered as toshow the pallet.', 'No sheets.', 'This was placed on the floor.In this bed Cosette was sleeping.The man approached and gazed down upon her.Cosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed.', 'In the wintershe did not undress, in order that she might not be so cold.Against her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, wide open,glittered in the dark.', 'From time to time she gave vent to a deep sighas though she were on the point of waking, and she strained the dollalmost convulsively in her arms.', 'Beside her bed there was only one ofher wooden shoes.A door which stood open near Cosette’s pallet permitted a view of arather large, dark room.', 'The stranger stepped into it.', 'At the furtherextremity, through a glass door, he saw two small, very white beds.They belonged to Éponine and Azelma.', 'Behind these beds, and halfhidden, stood an uncurtained wicker cradle, in which the little boy whohad cried all the evening lay asleep.The stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of theThénardier pair.', 'He was on the point of retreating when his eye fellupon the fireplace—one of those vast tavern chimneys where there isalways so little fire when there is any fire at all, and which are socold to look at.', 'There was no fire in this one, there was not evenashes; but there was something which attracted the stranger’s gaze,nevertheless.', 'It was two tiny children’s shoes, coquettish in shape andunequal in size.', 'The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorialcustom in accordance with which children place their shoes in thechimney on Christmas eve, there to await in the darkness some sparklinggift from their good fairy.', 'Éponine and Azelma had taken care not toomit this, and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth.The traveller bent over them.The fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid her visit,and in each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou piece.The man straightened himself up, and was on the point of withdrawing,when far in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sight ofanother object.', 'He looked at it, and recognized a wooden shoe, afrightful shoe of the coarsest description, half dilapidated and allcovered with ashes and dried mud.', 'It was Cosette’s sabot.', 'Cosette, withthat touching trust of childhood, which can always be deceived yetnever discouraged, had placed her shoe on the hearth-stone also.Hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet andtouching thing.There was nothing in this wooden shoe.The stranger fumbled in his waistcoat, bent over and placed a louisd’or in Cosette’s shoe.Then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf.CHAPTER IX— THÉNARDIER AND HIS MANŒUVRESOn the following morning, two hours at least before day-break,Thénardier, seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern,pen in hand, was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellowcoat.His wife, standing beside him, and half bent over him, was followinghim with her eyes.', 'They exchanged not a word.', 'On the one hand, therewas profound meditation, on the other, the religious admiration withwhich one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the humanmind.', 'A noise was audible in the house; it was the Lark sweeping thestairs.After the lapse of a good quarter of an hour, and some erasures,Thénardier produced the following masterpiece:—BILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No.', '1.Supper .', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '3 francs.Chamber  .', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '10   ” Candle .', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '5   ” Fire .', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '4   ” Service  .', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '1   ” —————Total .', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '23 francs.Service was written _servisse_.“Twenty-three francs!” cried the woman, with an enthusiasm which wasmingled with some hesitation.Like all great artists, Thénardier was dissatisfied.“Peuh!” he exclaimed.It was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France’s bill at the Congressof Vienna.“Monsieur Thénardier, you are right; he certainly owes that,” murmuredthe wife, who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette in thepresence of her daughters.', '“It is just, but it is too much.', 'He will notpay it.”Thénardier laughed coldly, as usual, and said:—“He will pay.”This laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority.', 'Thatwhich was asserted in this manner must needs be so.', 'His wife did notinsist.She set about arranging the table; her husband paced the room.', 'A momentlater he added:—“I owe full fifteen hundred francs!”He went and seated himself in the chimney-corner, meditating, with hisfeet among the warm ashes.“Ah!', 'by the way,” resumed his wife, “you don’t forget that I’m going toturn Cosette out of doors to-day?', 'The monster!', 'She breaks my heart withthat doll of hers!', 'I’d rather marry Louis XVIII.', 'than keep her anotherday in the house!”Thénardier lighted his pipe, and replied between two puffs:—“You will hand that bill to the man.”Then he went out.Hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered.Thénardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless inthe half-open door, visible only to his wife.The yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand.“Up so early?” said Madame Thénardier; “is Monsieur leaving usalready?”As she spoke thus, she was twisting the bill about in her hands with anembarrassed air, and making creases in it with her nails.', 'Her hard facepresented a shade which was not habitual with it,—timidity andscruples.To present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air “of apoor wretch” seemed difficult to her.The traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent-minded.', 'Hereplied:—“Yes, Madame, I am going.”“So Monsieur has no business in Montfermeil?”“No, I was passing through.', 'That is all.', 'What do I owe you, Madame,” headded.The Thénardier silently handed him the folded bill.The man unfolded the paper and glanced at it; but his thoughts wereevidently elsewhere.“Madame,” he resumed, “is business good here in Montfermeil?”“So so, Monsieur,” replied the Thénardier, stupefied at not witnessinganother sort of explosion.She continued, in a dreary and lamentable tone:—“Oh!', 'Monsieur, times are so hard!', 'and then, we have so few bourgeois inthe neighborhood!', 'All the people are poor, you see.', 'If we had not, nowand then, some rich and generous travellers like Monsieur, we shouldnot get along at all.', 'We have so many expenses.', 'Just see, that child iscosting us our very eyes.”“What child?”“Why, the little one, you know!', 'Cosette—the Lark, as she is calledhereabouts!”“Ah!” said the man.She went on:—“How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames!', 'She has more theair of a bat than of a lark.', 'You see, sir, we do not ask charity, andwe cannot bestow it.', 'We earn nothing and we have to pay out a greatdeal.', 'The license, the imposts, the door and window tax, thehundredths!', 'Monsieur is aware that the government demands a terribledeal of money.', 'And then, I have my daughters.', 'I have no need to bringup other people’s children.”The man resumed, in that voice which he strove to render indifferent,and in which there lingered a tremor:—“What if one were to rid you of her?”“Who?', 'Cosette?”“Yes.”The landlady’s red and violent face brightened up hideously.“Ah!', 'sir, my dear sir, take her, keep her, lead her off, carry heraway, sugar her, stuff her with truffles, drink her, eat her, and theblessings of the good holy Virgin and of all the saints of paradise beupon you!”“Agreed.”“Really!', 'You will take her away?”“I will take her away.”“Immediately?”“Immediately.', 'Call the child.”“Cosette!” screamed the Thénardier.“In the meantime,” pursued the man, “I will pay you what I owe you.', 'Howmuch is it?”He cast a glance on the bill, and could not restrain a start ofsurprise:—“Twenty-three francs!”He looked at the landlady, and repeated:—“Twenty-three francs?”There was in the enunciation of these words, thus repeated, an accentbetween an exclamation and an interrogation point.The Thénardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock.', 'Shereplied, with assurance:—“Good gracious, yes, sir, it is twenty-three francs.”The stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table.“Go and get the child,” said he.At that moment Thénardier advanced to the middle of the room, andsaid:—“Monsieur owes twenty-six sous.”“Twenty-six sous!” exclaimed his wife.“Twenty sous for the chamber,” resumed Thénardier, coldly, “and sixsous for his supper.', 'As for the child, I must discuss that matter alittle with the gentleman.', 'Leave us, wife.”Madame Thénardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpectedlightning flashes of talent.', 'She was conscious that a great actor wasmaking his entrance on the stage, uttered not a word in reply, and leftthe room.As soon as they were alone, Thénardier offered the traveller a chair.The traveller seated himself; Thénardier remained standing, and hisface assumed a singular expression of good-fellowship and simplicity.“Sir,” said he, “what I have to say to you is this, that I adore thatchild.”The stranger gazed intently at him.“What child?”Thénardier continued:—“How strange it is, one grows attached.', 'What money is that?', 'Take backyour hundred-sou piece.', 'I adore the child.”“Whom do you mean?” demanded the stranger.“Eh!', 'our little Cosette!', 'Are you not intending to take her away fromus?', 'Well, I speak frankly; as true as you are an honest man, I will notconsent to it.', 'I shall miss that child.', 'I saw her first when she was atiny thing.', 'It is true that she costs us money; it is true that she hasher faults; it is true that we are not rich; it is true that I havepaid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of herillnesses!', 'But one must do something for the good God’s sake.', 'She hasneither father nor mother.', 'I have brought her up.', 'I have bread enoughfor her and for myself.', 'In truth, I think a great deal of that child.You understand, one conceives an affection for a person; I am a goodsort of a beast, I am; I do not reason; I love that little girl; mywife is quick-tempered, but she loves her also.', 'You see, she is justthe same as our own child.', 'I want to keep her to babble about thehouse.”The stranger kept his eye intently fixed on Thénardier.', 'The lattercontinued:—“Excuse me, sir, but one does not give away one’s child to a passer-by,like that.', 'I am right, am I not?', 'Still, I don’t say—you are rich; youhave the air of a very good man,—if it were for her happiness.', 'But onemust find out that.', 'You understand: suppose that I were to let her goand to sacrifice myself, I should like to know what becomes of her; Ishould not wish to lose sight of her; I should like to know with whomshe is living, so that I could go to see her from time to time; so thatshe may know that her good foster-father is alive, that he is watchingover her.', 'In short, there are things which are not possible.', 'I do noteven know your name.', 'If you were to take her away, I should say: ‘Well,and the Lark, what has become of her?’ One must, at least, see somepetty scrap of paper, some trifle in the way of a passport, you know!”The stranger, still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates, asthe saying goes, to the very depths of the conscience, replied in agrave, firm voice:—“Monsieur Thénardier, one does not require a passport to travel fiveleagues from Paris.', 'If I take Cosette away, I shall take her away, andthat is the end of the matter.', 'You will not know my name, you will notknow my residence, you will not know where she is; and my intention isthat she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives.', 'Ibreak the thread which binds her foot, and she departs.', 'Does that suityou?', 'Yes or no?”Since geniuses, like demons, recognize the presence of a superior Godby certain signs, Thénardier comprehended that he had to deal with avery strong person.', 'It was like an intuition; he comprehended it withhis clear and sagacious promptitude.', 'While drinking with the carters,smoking, and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening, he haddevoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger, watching himlike a cat, and studying him like a mathematician.', 'He had watched him,both on his own account, for the pleasure of the thing, and throughinstinct, and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for sodoing.', 'Not a movement, not a gesture, on the part of the man in theyellow great-coat had escaped him.', 'Even before the stranger had soclearly manifested his interest in Cosette, Thénardier had divined hispurpose.', 'He had caught the old man’s deep glances returning constantlyto the child.', 'Who was this man?', 'Why this interest?', 'Why this hideouscostume, when he had so much money in his purse?', 'Questions which he putto himself without being able to solve them, and which irritated him.He had pondered it all night long.', 'He could not be Cosette’s father.Was he her grandfather?', 'Then why not make himself known at once?', 'Whenone has a right, one asserts it.', 'This man evidently had no right overCosette.', 'What was it, then?', 'Thénardier lost himself in conjectures.', 'Hecaught glimpses of everything, but he saw nothing.', 'Be that as it may,on entering into conversation with the man, sure that there was somesecret in the case, that the latter had some interest in remaining inthe shadow, he felt himself strong; when he perceived from thestranger’s clear and firm retort, that this mysterious personage wasmysterious in so simple a way, he became conscious that he was weak.', 'Hehad expected nothing of the sort.', 'His conjectures were put to the rout.He rallied his ideas.', 'He weighed everything in the space of a second.Thénardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance.', 'Hedecided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward, andquickly at that.', 'He did as great leaders do at the decisive moment,which they know that they alone recognize; he abruptly unmasked hisbatteries.“Sir,” said he, “I am in need of fifteen hundred francs.”The stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of blackleather, opened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on thetable.', 'Then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to theinn-keeper:—“Go and fetch Cosette.”While this was taking place, what had Cosette been doing?On waking up, Cosette had run to get her shoe.', 'In it she had found thegold piece.', 'It was not a Napoleon; it was one of those perfectly newtwenty-franc pieces of the Restoration, on whose effigy the littlePrussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath.', 'Cosette was dazzled.', 'Herdestiny began to intoxicate her.', 'She did not know what a gold piecewas; she had never seen one; she hid it quickly in her pocket, asthough she had stolen it.', 'Still, she felt that it really was hers; sheguessed whence her gift had come, but the joy which she experienced wasfull of fear.', 'She was happy; above all she was stupefied.', 'Suchmagnificent and beautiful things did not appear real.', 'The dollfrightened her, the gold piece frightened her.', 'She trembled vaguely inthe presence of this magnificence.', 'The stranger alone did not frightenher.', 'On the contrary, he reassured her.', 'Ever since the precedingevening, amid all her amazement, even in her sleep, she had beenthinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be sopoor and so sad, and who was so rich and so kind.', 'Everything hadchanged for her since she had met that good man in the forest.', 'Cosette,less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven, had neverknown what it was to take refuge under a mother’s shadow and under awing.', 'For the last five years, that is to say, as far back as hermemory ran, the poor child had shivered and trembled.', 'She had alwaysbeen exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity; now itseemed to her she was clothed.', 'Formerly her soul had seemed cold, nowit was warm.', 'Cosette was no longer afraid of the Thénardier.', 'She was nolonger alone; there was some one there.She hastily set about her regular morning duties.', 'That louis, which shehad about her, in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou piecehad fallen on the night before, distracted her thoughts.', 'She dared nottouch it, but she spent five minutes in gazing at it, with her tonguehanging out, if the truth must be told.', 'As she swept the staircase, shepaused, remained standing there motionless, forgetful of her broom andof the entire universe, occupied in gazing at that star which wasblazing at the bottom of her pocket.It was during one of these periods of contemplation that the Thénardierjoined her.', 'She had gone in search of Cosette at her husband’s orders.What was quite unprecedented, she neither struck her nor said aninsulting word to her.“Cosette,” she said, almost gently, “come immediately.”An instant later Cosette entered the public room.The stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it.This bundle contained a little woollen gown, an apron, a fustianbodice, a kerchief, a petticoat, woollen stockings, shoes—a completeoutfit for a girl of seven years.', 'All was black.“My child,” said the man, “take these, and go and dress yourselfquickly.”Daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil whohad begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading alittle girl dressed in mourning, and carrying a pink doll in her arms,pass along the road to Paris.', 'They were going in the direction ofLivry.It was our man and Cosette.No one knew the man; as Cosette was no longer in rags, many did notrecognize her.', 'Cosette was going away.', 'With whom?', 'She did not know.Whither?', 'She knew not.', 'All that she understood was that she was leavingthe Thénardier tavern behind her.', 'No one had thought of bidding herfarewell, nor had she thought of taking leave of any one.', 'She wasleaving that hated and hating house.Poor, gentle creature, whose heart had been repressed up to that hour!Cosette walked along gravely, with her large eyes wide open, and gazingat the sky.', 'She had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron.', 'Fromtime to time, she bent down and glanced at it; then she looked at thegood man.', 'She felt something as though she were beside the good God.CHAPTER X—HE WHO SEEKS TO BETTER HIMSELF MAY RENDER HIS SITUATION WORSEMadame Thénardier had allowed her husband to have his own way, as washer wont.', 'She had expected great results.', 'When the man and Cosette hadtaken their departure, Thénardier allowed a full quarter of an hour toelapse; then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundredfrancs.“Is that all?” said she.It was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she haddared to criticise one of the master’s acts.The blow told.“You are right, in sooth,” said he; “I am a fool.', 'Give me my hat.”He folded up the three bank-bills, thrust them into his pocket, and ranout in all haste; but he made a mistake and turned to the right first.Some neighbors, of whom he made inquiries, put him on the track again;the Lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of Livry.', 'Hefollowed these hints, walking with great strides, and talking tohimself the while:—“That man is evidently a million dressed in yellow, and I am an animal.First he gave twenty sous, then five francs, then fifty francs, thenfifteen hundred francs, all with equal readiness.', 'He would have givenfifteen thousand francs.', 'But I shall overtake him.”And then, that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child; allthat was singular; many mysteries lay concealed under it.', 'One does notlet mysteries out of one’s hand when one has once grasped them.', 'Thesecrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold; one must know how tosubject them to pressure.', 'All these thoughts whirled through his brain.“I am an animal,” said he.When one leaves Montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takesthat runs to Livry, it can be seen stretching out before one to a greatdistance across the plateau.', 'On arriving there, he calculated that heought to be able to see the old man and the child.', 'He looked as far ashis vision reached, and saw nothing.', 'He made fresh inquiries, but hehad wasted time.', 'Some passers-by informed him that the man and child ofwhom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction ofGagny.', 'He hastened in that direction.They were far in advance of him; but a child walks slowly, and hewalked fast; and then, he was well acquainted with the country.All at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like aman who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retracehis steps.“I ought to have taken my gun,” said he to himself.Thénardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass throughour midst without our being aware of the fact, and who disappearwithout our finding them out, because destiny has only exhibited oneside of them.', 'It is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged.In a calm and even situation, Thénardier possessed all that is requiredto make—we will not say to be—what people have agreed to call an honesttrader, a good bourgeois.', 'At the same time certain circumstances beinggiven, certain shocks arriving to bring his under-nature to thesurface, he had all the requisites for a blackguard.', 'He was ashopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster.', 'Satan must haveoccasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in whichThénardier dwelt, and have fallen a-dreaming in the presence of thishideous masterpiece.After a momentary hesitation:—“Bah!” he thought; “they will have time to make their escape.”And he pursued his road, walking rapidly straight ahead, and withalmost an air of certainty, with the sagacity of a fox scenting a coveyof partridges.In truth, when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an obliquedirection the large clearing which lies on the right of the Avenue deBellevue, and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit ofthe hill, and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the Abbey ofChelles, he caught sight, over the top of the brushwood, of the hat onwhich he had already erected so many conjectures; it was that man’shat.', 'The brushwood was not high.', 'Thénardier recognized the fact thatthe man and Cosette were sitting there.', 'The child could not be seen onaccount of her small size, but the head of her doll was visible.Thénardier was not mistaken.', 'The man was sitting there, and lettingCosette get somewhat rested.', 'The inn-keeper walked round the brushwoodand presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was insearch of.“Pardon, excuse me, sir,” he said, quite breathless, “but here are yourfifteen hundred francs.”So saying, he handed the stranger the three bank-bills.The man raised his eyes.“What is the meaning of this?”Thénardier replied respectfully:—“It means, sir, that I shall take back Cosette.”Cosette shuddered, and pressed close to the old man.He replied, gazing to the very bottom of Thénardier’s eyes the while,and enunciating every syllable distinctly:—“You are go-ing to take back Co-sette?”“Yes, sir, I am.', 'I will tell you; I have considered the matter.', 'Infact, I have not the right to give her to you.', 'I am an honest man, yousee; this child does not belong to me; she belongs to her mother.', 'Itwas her mother who confided her to me; I can only resign her to hermother.', 'You will say to me, ‘But her mother is dead.’ Good; in thatcase I can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me awriting, signed by her mother, to the effect that I am to hand thechild over to the person therein mentioned; that is clear.”The man, without making any reply, fumbled in his pocket, andThénardier beheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearanceonce more.The tavern-keeper shivered with joy.“Good!” thought he; “let us hold firm; he is going to bribe me!”Before opening the pocket-book, the traveller cast a glance about him:the spot was absolutely deserted; there was not a soul either in thewoods or in the valley.', 'The man opened his pocket-book once more anddrew from it, not the handful of bills which Thénardier expected, but asimple little paper, which he unfolded and presented fully open to theinn-keeper, saying:—“You are right; read!”Thénardier took the paper and read:—“M.', 'SUR M., March 25, 1823.“MONSIEUR THÉNARDIER:—You will deliver Cosette to this person.You will be paid for all the little things.I have the honor to salute you with respect,FANTINE.”“You know that signature?” resumed the man.It certainly was Fantine’s signature; Thénardier recognized it.There was no reply to make; he experienced two violent vexations, thevexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for, and thevexation of being beaten; the man added:—“You may keep this paper as your receipt.”Thénardier retreated in tolerably good order.“This signature is fairly well imitated,” he growled between his teeth;“however, let it go!”Then he essayed a desperate effort.“It is well, sir,” he said, “since you are the person, but I must bepaid for all those little things.', 'A great deal is owing to me.”The man rose to his feet, filliping the dust from his threadbaresleeve:—“Monsieur Thénardier, in January last, the mother reckoned that sheowed you one hundred and twenty francs.', 'In February, you sent her abill of five hundred francs; you received three hundred francs at theend of February, and three hundred francs at the beginning of March.Since then nine months have elapsed, at fifteen francs a month, theprice agreed upon, which makes one hundred and thirty-five francs.', 'Youhad received one hundred francs too much; that makes thirty-five stillowing you.', 'I have just given you fifteen hundred francs.”Thénardier’s sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when hefeels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap.“Who is this devil of a man?” he thought.He did what the wolf does: he shook himself.', 'Audacity had succeededwith him once.“Monsieur-I-don’t-know-your-name,” he said resolutely, and this timecasting aside all respectful ceremony, “I shall take back Cosette ifyou do not give me a thousand crowns.”The stranger said tranquilly:—“Come, Cosette.”He took Cosette by his left hand, and with his right he picked up hiscudgel, which was lying on the ground.Thénardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude ofthe spot.The man plunged into the forest with the child, leaving the inn-keepermotionless and speechless.While they were walking away, Thénardier scrutinized his hugeshoulders, which were a little rounded, and his great fists.Then, bringing his eyes back to his own person, they fell upon hisfeeble arms and his thin hands.', '“I really must have been exceedinglystupid not to have thought to bring my gun,” he said to himself, “sinceI was going hunting!”However, the inn-keeper did not give up.“I want to know where he is going,” said he, and he set out to followthem at a distance.', 'Two things were left on his hands, an irony in theshape of the paper signed _Fantine_, and a consolation, the fifteenhundred francs.The man led Cosette off in the direction of Livry and Bondy.', 'He walkedslowly, with drooping head, in an attitude of reflection and sadness.The winter had thinned out the forest, so that Thénardier did not losethem from sight, although he kept at a good distance.', 'The man turnedround from time to time, and looked to see if he was being followed.All at once he caught sight of Thénardier.', 'He plunged suddenly into thebrushwood with Cosette, where they could both hide themselves.', '“Thedeuce!” said Thénardier, and he redoubled his pace.The thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them.When the man had reached the densest part of the thicket, he wheeledround.', 'It was in vain that Thénardier sought to conceal himself in thebranches; he could not prevent the man seeing him.', 'The man cast uponhim an uneasy glance, then elevated his head and continued his course.The inn-keeper set out again in pursuit.', 'Thus they continued for two orthree hundred paces.', 'All at once the man turned round once more; he sawthe inn-keeper.', 'This time he gazed at him with so sombre an air thatThénardier decided that it was “useless” to proceed further.', 'Thénardierretraced his steps.CHAPTER XI—NUMBER 9,430 REAPPEARS, AND COSETTE WINS IT IN THE LOTTERYJean Valjean was not dead.When he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself into it, hewas not ironed, as we have seen.', 'He swam under water until he reached avessel at anchor, to which a boat was moored.', 'He found means of hidinghimself in this boat until night.', 'At night he swam off again, andreached the shore a little way from Cape Brun.', 'There, as he did notlack money, he procured clothing.', 'A small country-house in theneighborhood of Balaguier was at that time the dressing-room of escapedconvicts,—a lucrative specialty.', 'Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorryfugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and socialfatality, pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary.', 'He found hisfirst refuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset.', 'Then he directed his coursetowards Grand-Villard, near Briançon, in the Hautes-Alpes.', 'It was afumbling and uneasy flight,—a mole’s track, whose branchings areuntraceable.', 'Later on, some trace of his passage into Ain, in theterritory of Civrieux, was discovered; in the Pyrenees, at Accons; atthe spot called Grange-de-Doumec, near the market of Chavailles, and inthe environs of Perigueux at Brunies, canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet.He reached Paris.', 'We have just seen him at Montfermeil.His first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothesfor a little girl of from seven to eight years of age; then to procurea lodging.', 'That done, he had betaken himself to Montfermeil.', 'It will beremembered that already, during his preceding escape, he had made amysterious trip thither, or somewhere in that neighborhood, of whichthe law had gathered an inkling.However, he was thought to be dead, and this still further increasedthe obscurity which had gathered about him.', 'At Paris, one of thejournals which chronicled the fact fell into his hands.', 'He feltreassured and almost at peace, as though he had really been dead.On the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from theclaws of the Thénardiers, he returned to Paris.', 'He re-entered it atnightfall, with the child, by way of the Barrier Monceaux.', 'There heentered a cabriolet, which took him to the esplanade of theObservatoire.', 'There he got out, paid the coachman, took Cosette by thehand, and together they directed their steps through thedarkness,—through the deserted streets which adjoin the Ourcine and theGlacière, towards the Boulevard de l’Hôpital.The day had been strange and filled with emotions for Cosette.', 'They hadeaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns, behindhedges; they had changed carriages frequently; they had travelled shortdistances on foot.', 'She made no complaint, but she was weary, and JeanValjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his handas she walked.', 'He took her on his back.', 'Cosette, without letting go ofCatherine, laid her head on Jean Valjean’s shoulder, and there fellasleep.BOOK FOURTH—THE GORBEAU HOVEL  EnlargeThe Gorbeau Hovel  2b3-10-gorbeau-houseCHAPTER I—MASTER GORBEAUForty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown countryof the Salpêtrière, and who had mounted to the Barrière d’Italie by wayof the boulevard, reached a point where it might be said that Parisdisappeared.', 'It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; itwas not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not thecity, for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass grew inthem; it was not a village, the houses were too lofty.', 'What was it,then?', 'It was an inhabited spot where there was no one; it was a desertplace where there was some one; it was a boulevard of the great city, astreet of Paris; more wild at night than the forest, more gloomy by daythan a cemetery.It was the old quarter of the Marché-aux-Chevaux.The rambler, if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls ofthis Marché-aux-Chevaux; if he consented even to pass beyond the Rue duPetit-Banquier, after leaving on his right a garden protected by highwalls; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose like gigantic beaverhuts; then an enclosure encumbered with timber, with a heap of stumps,sawdust, and shavings, on which stood a large dog, barking; then along, low, utterly dilapidated wall, with a little black door inmourning, laden with mosses, which were covered with flowers in thespring; then, in the most deserted spot, a frightful and decrepitbuilding, on which ran the inscription in large letters: POST NOBILLS,—this daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes atthe corner of the Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel.', 'There, near a factory,and between two garden walls, there could be seen, at that epoch, amean building, which, at the first glance, seemed as small as athatched hovel, and which was, in reality, as large as a cathedral.', 'Itpresented its side and gable to the public road; hence its apparentdiminutiveness.', 'Nearly the whole of the house was hidden.', 'Only the doorand one window could be seen.This hovel was only one story high.The first detail that struck the observer was, that the door couldnever have been anything but the door of a hovel, while the window, ifit had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in roughmasonry, might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion.The door was nothing but a collection of worm-eaten planks roughlybound together by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs.', 'Itopened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps, muddy, chalky,plaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width as itself, which couldbe seen from the street, running straight up like a ladder anddisappearing in the darkness between two walls.', 'The top of theshapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrowscantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed,which served both as wicket and air-hole when the door was closed.', 'Onthe inside of the door the figures 52 had been traced with a couple ofstrokes of a brush dipped in ink, and above the scantling the same handhad daubed the number 50, so that one hesitated.', 'Where was one?', 'Abovethe door it said, “Number 50”; the inside replied, “no, Number 52.” Noone knows what dust-colored figures were suspended like draperies fromthe triangular opening.The window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with Venetianblinds, and with a frame in large square panes; only these large paneswere suffering from various wounds, which were both concealed andbetrayed by an ingenious paper bandage.', 'And the blinds, dislocated andunpasted, threatened passers-by rather than screened the occupants.', 'Thehorizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naïvelyreplaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly; so that what began as ablind ended as a shutter.', 'This door with an unclean, and this windowwith an honest though dilapidated air, thus beheld on the same house,produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side,with different miens beneath the same rags, the one having always beena mendicant, and the other having once been a gentleman.The staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed whichhad been converted into a house.', 'This edifice had, for its intestinaltube, a long corridor, on which opened to right and left sorts ofcompartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stressof circumstances, and rather more like stalls than cells.', 'Thesechambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in theneighborhood.All this was dark, disagreeable, wan, melancholy, sepulchral; traversedaccording as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door, by cold raysor by icy winds.', 'An interesting and picturesque peculiarity of thissort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders.To the left of the entrance door, on the boulevard side, at about theheight of a man from the ground, a small window which had been walledup formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrownthere as they passed by.A portion of this building has recently been demolished.', 'From whatstill remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in formerdays.', 'As a whole, it was not over a hundred years old.', 'A hundred yearsis youth in a church and age in a house.', 'It seems as though man’slodging partook of his ephemeral character, and God’s house of hiseternity.The postmen called the house Number 50-52; but it was known in theneighborhood as the Gorbeau house.Let us explain whence this appellation was derived.Collectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, andprick slippery dates into their memories with a pin, know that therewas in Paris, during the last century, about 1770, two attorneys at theChâtelet named, one Corbeau (Raven), the other Renard (Fox).', 'The twonames had been forestalled by La Fontaine.', 'The opportunity was too finefor the lawyers; they made the most of it.', 'A parody was immediately putin circulation in the galleries of the court-house, in verses thatlimped a little:—Maître Corbeau, sur un dossier perché,Tenait dans son bec une saisie exécutoire;Maître Renard, par l’odeur alléché,Lui fit à peu près cette histoire:Hé!', 'bonjour.', 'Etc.13The two honest practitioners, embarrassed by the jests, and finding thebearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter whichfollowed them, resolved to get rid of their names, and hit upon theexpedient of applying to the king.Their petition was presented to Louis XV.', 'on the same day when thePapal Nuncio, on the one hand, and the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon onthe other, both devoutly kneeling, were each engaged in putting on, inhis Majesty’s presence, a slipper on the bare feet of Madame du Barry,who had just got out of bed.', 'The king, who was laughing, continued tolaugh, passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers, andbestowed on these limbs of the law their former names, or nearly so.', 'Bythe kings command, Maître Corbeau was permitted to add a tail to hisinitial letter and to call himself Gorbeau.', 'Maître Renard was lesslucky; all he obtained was leave to place a P in front of his R, and tocall himself Prenard; so that the second name bore almost as muchresemblance as the first.Now, according to local tradition, this Maître Gorbeau had been theproprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard del’Hôpital.', 'He was even the author of the monumental window.Hence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house.Opposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose a great elmwhich was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing it opens the Ruede la Barrière des Gobelins, a street then without houses, unpaved,planted with unhealthy trees, which was green or muddy according to theseason, and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris.', 'An odorof copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory.The barrier was close at hand.', 'In 1823 the city wall was still inexistence.This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind.', 'It was the roadto Bicêtre.', 'It was through it that, under the Empire and theRestoration, prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the dayof their execution.', 'It was there, that, about 1829, was committed thatmysterious assassination, called “The assassination of theFontainebleau barrier,” whose authors justice was never able todiscover; a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated, afrightful enigma which has never been unriddled.', 'Take a few steps, andyou come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe, where Ulbach stabbed thegoat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder, as in the melodramas.', 'A fewpaces more, and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of theBarrière Saint-Jacques, that expedient of the philanthropist to concealthe scaffold, that miserable and shameful Place de Grève of ashop-keeping and bourgeois society, which recoiled before the deathpenalty, neither daring to abolish it with grandeur, nor to uphold itwith authority.Leaving aside this Place Saint-Jacques, which was, as it were,predestined, and which has always been horrible, probably the mostmournful spot on that mournful boulevard, seven and thirty years ago,was the spot which even to-day is so unattractive, where stood thebuilding Number 50-52.Bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five years later.The place was unpleasant.', 'In addition to the gloomy thoughts whichassailed one there, one was conscious of being between the Salpêtrière,a glimpse of whose dome could be seen, and Bicêtre, whose outskirts onewas fairly touching; that is to say, between the madness of women andthe madness of men.', 'As far as the eye could see, one could perceivenothing but the abattoirs, the city wall, and the fronts of a fewfactories, resembling barracks or monasteries; everywhere about stoodhovels, rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new whitewalls like winding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of trees, buildingserected on a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and themelancholy sadness of right angles.', 'Not an unevenness of the ground,not a caprice in the architecture, not a fold.', 'The _ensemble_ wasglacial, regular, hideous.', 'Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry.It is because symmetry is ennui, and ennui is at the very foundation ofgrief.', 'Despair yawns.', 'Something more terrible than a hell where onesuffers may be imagined, and that is a hell where one is bored.', 'If sucha hell existed, that bit of the Boulevard de l’Hôpital might haveformed the entrance to it.Nevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight isvanishing, especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight breezetears from the elms their last russet leaves, when the darkness is deepand starless, or when the moon and the wind are making openings in theclouds and losing themselves in the shadows, this boulevard suddenlybecomes frightful.', 'The black lines sink inwards and are lost in theshades, like morsels of the infinite.', 'The passer-by cannot refrain fromrecalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connectedwith the gibbet.', 'The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes havebeen committed, had something terrible about it.', 'One almost had apresentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confusedforms of the darkness seemed suspicious, and the long, hollow square,of which one caught a glimpse between each tree, seemed graves: by dayit was ugly; in the evening melancholy; by night it was sinister.In summer, at twilight, one saw, here and there, a few old women seatedat the foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain.', 'These good oldwomen were fond of begging.However, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than an antiqueair, was tending even then to transformation.', 'Even at that time any onewho was desirous of seeing it had to make haste.', 'Each day some detailof the whole effect was disappearing.', 'For the last twenty years thestation of the Orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg anddistracted it, as it does to-day.', 'Wherever it is placed on the bordersof a capital, a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birthof a city.', 'It seems as though, around these great centres of themovements of a people, the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned,to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to springforth, at the rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of thesemonstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire.', 'Theold houses crumble and new ones rise.Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpêtrière,the ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and theJardin des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed three orfour times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuseswhich, in a given time, crowd back the houses to the right and theleft; for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorouslyexact; and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makesthe southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow, it is certain thatthe frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets.', 'The symptoms of anew life are evident.', 'In this old provincial quarter, in the wildestnooks, the pavement shows itself, the sidewalks begin to crawl and togrow longer, even where there are as yet no pedestrians.', 'One morning,—amemorable morning in July, 1845,—black pots of bitumen were seensmoking there; on that day it might be said that civilization hadarrived in the Rue de l’Ourcine, and that Paris had entered the suburbof Saint-Marceau.CHAPTER II—A NEST FOR OWL AND A WARBLERIt was in front of this Gorbeau house that Jean Valjean halted.', 'Likewild birds, he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest.He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, drew out a sort of a pass-key,opened the door, entered, closed it again carefully, and ascended thestaircase, still carrying Cosette.At the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key, withwhich he opened another door.', 'The chamber which he entered, and whichhe closed again instantly, was a kind of moderately spacious attic,furnished with a mattress laid on the floor, a table, and severalchairs; a stove in which a fire was burning, and whose embers werevisible, stood in one corner.', 'A lantern on the boulevard cast a vaguelight into this poor room.', 'At the extreme end there was a dressing-roomwith a folding bed; Jean Valjean carried the child to this bed and laidher down there without waking her.He struck a match and lighted a candle.', 'All this was preparedbeforehand on the table, and, as he had done on the previous evening,he began to scrutinize Cosette’s face with a gaze full of ecstasy, inwhich the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted toaberration.', 'The little girl, with that tranquil confidence whichbelongs only to extreme strength and extreme weakness, had fallenasleep without knowing with whom she was, and continued to sleepwithout knowing where she was.Jean Valjean bent down and kissed that child’s hand.Nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother, who had alsojust fallen asleep.The same sad, piercing, religious sentiment filled his heart.He knelt beside Cosette’s bed.lt was broad daylight, and the child still slept.', 'A wan ray of theDecember sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon theceiling in long threads of light and shade.', 'All at once a heavily ladencarrier’s cart, which was passing along the boulevard, shook the frailbed, like a clap of thunder, and made it quiver from top to bottom.“Yes, madame!” cried Cosette, waking with a start, “here I am!', 'here Iam!”And she sprang out of bed, her eyes still half shut with the heavinessof sleep, extending her arms towards the corner of the wall.“Ah!', 'mon Dieu, my broom!” said she.She opened her eyes wide now, and beheld the smiling countenance ofJean Valjean.“Ah!', 'so it is true!” said the child.', '“Good morning, Monsieur.”Children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly, beingthemselves by nature joy and happiness.Cosette caught sight of Catherine at the foot of her bed, and tookpossession of her, and, as she played, she put a hundred questions toJean Valjean.', 'Where was she?', 'Was Paris very large?', 'Was MadameThénardier very far away?', 'Was she to go back?', 'etc., etc.', 'All at onceshe exclaimed, “How pretty it is here!”It was a frightful hole, but she felt free.“Must I sweep?” she resumed at last.“Play!” said Jean Valjean.The day passed thus.', 'Cosette, without troubling herself to understandanything, was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man.CHAPTER III—TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNEOn the following morning, at daybreak, Jean Valjean was still byCosette’s bedside; he watched there motionless, waiting for her towake.Some new thing had come into his soul.Jean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty-five years he hadbeen alone in the world.', 'He had never been father, lover, husband,friend.', 'In the prison he had been vicious, gloomy, chaste, ignorant,and shy.', 'The heart of that ex-convict was full of virginity.', 'His sisterand his sister’s children had left him only a vague and far-off memorywhich had finally almost completely vanished; he had made every effortto find them, and not having been able to find them, he had forgottenthem.', 'Human nature is made thus; the other tender emotions of hisyouth, if he had ever had any, had fallen into an abyss.When he saw Cosette, when he had taken possession of her, carried heroff, and delivered her, he felt his heart moved within him.All the passion and affection within him awoke, and rushed towards thatchild.', 'He approached the bed, where she lay sleeping, and trembled withjoy.', 'He suffered all the pangs of a mother, and he knew not what itmeant; for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins tolove is a very obscure and a very sweet thing.Poor old man, with a perfectly new heart!Only, as he was five and fifty, and Cosette eight years of age, allthat might have been love in the whole course of his life flowedtogether into a sort of ineffable light.It was the second white apparition which he had encountered.', 'The Bishophad caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon; Cosette causedthe dawn of love to rise.The early days passed in this dazzled state.Cosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become anotherbeing, poor little thing!', 'She was so little when her mother left her,that she no longer remembered her.', 'Like all children, who resembleyoung shoots of the vine, which cling to everything, she had tried tolove; she had not succeeded.', 'All had repulsed her,—the Thénardiers,their children, other children.', 'She had loved the dog, and he had died,after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her.', 'Itis a sad thing to say, and we have already intimated it, that, at eightyears of age, her heart was cold.', 'It was not her fault; it was not thefaculty of loving that she lacked; alas!', 'it was the possibility.', 'Thus,from the very first day, all her sentient and thinking powers lovedthis kind man.', 'She felt that which she had never felt before—asensation of expansion.The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor; shethought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought the hovel pretty.These are the effects of the dawn, of childhood, of joy.', 'The novelty ofthe earth and of life counts for something here.', 'Nothing is so charmingas the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret.', 'We all have in ourpast a delightful garret.Nature, a difference of fifty years, had set a profound gulf betweenJean Valjean and Cosette; destiny filled in this gulf.', 'Destiny suddenlyunited and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprootedexistences, differing in age, alike in sorrow.', 'One, in fact, completedthe other.', 'Cosette’s instinct sought a father, as Jean Valjean’sinstinct sought a child.', 'To meet was to find each other.', 'At themysterious moment when their hands touched, they were welded together.When these two souls perceived each other, they recognized each otheras necessary to each other, and embraced each other closely.Taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense, we maysay that, separated from every one by the walls of the tomb, JeanValjean was the widower, and Cosette was the orphan: this situationcaused Jean Valjean to become Cosette’s father after a celestialfashion.And in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in thedepths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean graspinghers in the dark was not an illusion, but a reality.', 'The entrance ofthat man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of God.Moreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well.', 'There he seemedperfectly secure.The chamber with a dressing-room, which he occupied with Cosette, wasthe one whose window opened on the boulevard.', 'This being the onlywindow in the house, no neighbors’ glances were to be feared fromacross the way or at the side.The ground floor of Number 50-52, a sort of dilapidated penthouse,served as a wagon-house for market-gardeners, and no communicationexisted between it and the first story.', 'It was separated by theflooring, which had neither traps nor stairs, and which formed thediaphragm of the building, as it were.', 'The first story contained, as wehave said, numerous chambers and several attics, only one of which wasoccupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean Valjean’shousekeeping; all the rest was uninhabited.It was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the _principallodger_, and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, whohad let him the lodging on Christmas eve.', 'He had represented himself toher as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by Spanish bonds, whowas coming there to live with his little daughter.', 'He had paid her sixmonths in advance, and had commissioned the old woman to furnish thechamber and dressing-room, as we have seen.', 'It was this good woman whohad lighted the fire in the stove, and prepared everything on theevening of their arrival.Week followed week; these two beings led a happy life in that hovel.Cosette laughed, chattered, and sang from daybreak.', 'Children have theirmorning song as well as birds.It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, allcracked with chilblains, and kissed it.', 'The poor child, who was used tobeing beaten, did not know the meaning of this, and ran away inconfusion.At times she became serious and stared at her little black gown.Cosette was no longer in rags; she was in mourning.', 'She had emergedfrom misery, and she was entering into life.Jean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read.', 'Sometimes, as he madethe child spell, he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evilthat he had learned to read in prison.', 'This idea had ended in teachinga child to read.', 'Then the ex-convict smiled with the pensive smile ofthe angels.He felt in it a premeditation from on high, the will of some one whowas not man, and he became absorbed in reverie.', 'Good thoughts havetheir abysses as well as evil ones.To teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted nearlythe whole of Jean Valjean’s existence.', 'And then he talked of hermother, and he made her pray.She called him _father_, and knew no other name for him.He passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll, andin listening to her prattle.', 'Life, henceforth, appeared to him to befull of interest; men seemed to him good and just; he no longerreproached any one in thought; he saw no reason why he should not liveto be a very old man, now that this child loved him.', 'He saw a wholefuture stretching out before him, illuminated by Cosette as by acharming light.', 'The best of us are not exempt from egotisticalthoughts.', 'At times, he reflected with a sort of joy that she would beugly.This is only a personal opinion; but, to utter our whole thought, atthe point where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love Cosette,it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragementin order that he might persevere in well-doing.', 'He had just viewed themalice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect—incompleteaspects, which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth, thefate of woman as summed up in Fantine, and public authority aspersonified in Javert.', 'He had returned to prison, this time for havingdone right; he had quaffed fresh bitterness; disgust and lassitude wereoverpowering him; even the memory of the Bishop probably suffered atemporary eclipse, though sure to reappear later on luminous andtriumphant; but, after all, that sacred memory was growing dim.', 'Whoknows whether Jean Valjean had not been on the eve of growingdiscouraged and of falling once more?', 'He loved and grew strong again.Alas!', 'he walked with no less indecision than Cosette.', 'He protected her,and she strengthened him.', 'Thanks to him, she could walk through life;thanks to her, he could continue in virtue.', 'He was that child’s stay,and she was his prop.', 'Oh, unfathomable and divine mystery of thebalances of destiny!CHAPTER IV—THE REMARKS OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANTJean Valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day.', 'Every evening,at twilight, he walked for an hour or two, sometimes alone, often withCosette, seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard, andentering churches at nightfall.', 'He liked to go to Saint-Médard, whichis the nearest church.', 'When he did not take Cosette with him, sheremained with the old woman; but the child’s delight was to go out withthe good man.', 'She preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous_tête-à-têtes_ with Catherine.', 'He held her hand as they walked, andsaid sweet things to her.It turned out that Cosette was a very gay little person.The old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went tomarket.They lived soberly, always having a little fire, but like people invery moderate circumstances.', 'Jean Valjean had made no alterations inthe furniture as it was the first day; he had merely had the glass doorleading to Cosette’s dressing-room replaced by a solid door.He still wore his yellow coat, his black breeches, and his old hat.', 'Inthe street, he was taken for a poor man.', 'It sometimes happened thatkind-hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him.', 'Jean Valjeanaccepted the sou with a deep bow.', 'It also happened occasionally that heencountered some poor wretch asking alms; then he looked behind him tomake sure that no one was observing him, stealthily approached theunfortunate man, put a piece of money into his hand, often a silvercoin, and walked rapidly away.', 'This had its disadvantages.', 'He began tobe known in the neighborhood under the name of _the beggar who givesalms_.The old _principal lodger_, a cross-looking creature, who wasthoroughly permeated, so far as her neighbors were concerned, with theinquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons, scrutinized Jean Valjean agreat deal, without his suspecting the fact.', 'She was a little deaf,which rendered her talkative.', 'There remained to her from her past, twoteeth,—one above, the other below,—which she was continually knockingagainst each other.', 'She had questioned Cosette, who had not been ableto tell her anything, since she knew nothing herself except that shehad come from Montfermeil.', 'One morning, this spy saw Jean Valjean, withan air which struck the old gossip as peculiar, entering one of theuninhabited compartments of the hovel.', 'She followed him with the stepof an old cat, and was able to observe him without being seen, througha crack in the door, which was directly opposite him.', 'Jean Valjean hadhis back turned towards this door, by way of greater security, nodoubt.', 'The old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence acase, scissors, and thread; then he began to rip the lining of one ofthe skirts of his coat, and from the opening he took a bit of yellowishpaper, which he unfolded.', 'The old woman recognized, with terror, thefact that it was a bank-bill for a thousand francs.', 'It was the secondor third only that she had seen in the course of her existence.', 'Shefled in alarm.A moment later, Jean Valjean accosted her, and asked her to go and getthis thousand-franc bill changed for him, adding that it was hisquarterly income, which he had received the day before.', '“Where?”thought the old woman.', '“He did not go out until six o’clock in theevening, and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour.”The old woman went to get the bill changed, and mentioned her surmises.That thousand-franc note, commented on and multiplied, produced a vastamount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the Rue des VignesSaint-Marcel.A few days later, it chanced that Jean Valjean was sawing some wood, inhis shirt-sleeves, in the corridor.', 'The old woman was in the chamber,putting things in order.', 'She was alone.', 'Cosette was occupied inadmiring the wood as it was sawed.', 'The old woman caught sight of thecoat hanging on a nail, and examined it.', 'The lining had been sewed upagain.', 'The good woman felt of it carefully, and thought she observed inthe skirts and revers thicknesses of paper.', 'More thousand-francbank-bills, no doubt!She also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets.Not only the needles, thread, and scissors which she had seen, but abig pocket-book, a very large knife, and—a suspiciouscircumstance—several wigs of various colors.', 'Each pocket of this coathad the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents.Thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter.CHAPTER V—A FIVE-FRANC PIECE FALLS ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES A TUMULTNear Saint-Médard’s church there was a poor man who was in the habit ofcrouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned, andon whom Jean Valjean was fond of bestowing charity.', 'He never passedthis man without giving him a few sous.', 'Sometimes he spoke to him.Those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police.', 'Hewas an ex-beadle of seventy-five, who was constantly mumbling hisprayers.One evening, as Jean Valjean was passing by, when he had not Cosettewith him, he saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath the lanternwhich had just been lighted.', 'The man seemed engaged in prayer,according to his custom, and was much bent over.', 'Jean Valjean steppedup to him and placed his customary alms in his hand.', 'The mendicantraised his eyes suddenly, stared intently at Jean Valjean, then droppedhis head quickly.', 'This movement was like a flash of lightning.', 'JeanValjean was seized with a shudder.', 'It seemed to him that he had justcaught sight, by the light of the street lantern, not of the placid andbeaming visage of the old beadle, but of a well-known and startlingface.', 'He experienced the same impression that one would have on findingone’s self, all of a sudden, face to face, in the dark, with a tiger.He recoiled, terrified, petrified, daring neither to breathe, to speak,to remain, nor to flee, staring at the beggar who had dropped his head,which was enveloped in a rag, and no longer appeared to know that hewas there.', 'At this strange moment, an instinct—possibly the mysteriousinstinct of self-preservation,—restrained Jean Valjean from uttering aword.', 'The beggar had the same figure, the same rags, the sameappearance as he had every day.', '“Bah!” said Jean Valjean, “I am mad!', 'Iam dreaming!', 'Impossible!” And he returned profoundly troubled.He hardly dared to confess, even to himself, that the face which hethought he had seen was the face of Javert.That night, on thinking the matter over, he regretted not havingquestioned the man, in order to force him to raise his head a secondtime.On the following day, at nightfall, he went back.', 'The beggar was at hispost.', '“Good day, my good man,” said Jean Valjean, resolutely, handinghim a sou.', 'The beggar raised his head, and replied in a whining voice,“Thanks, my good sir.” It was unmistakably the ex-beadle.Jean Valjean felt completely reassured.', 'He began to laugh.', '“How thedeuce could I have thought that I saw Javert there?” he thought.', '“Am Igoing to lose my eyesight now?” And he thought no more about it.A few days afterwards,—it might have been at eight o’clock in theevening,—he was in his room, and engaged in making Cosette spell aloud,when he heard the house door open and then shut again.', 'This struck himas singular.', 'The old woman, who was the only inhabitant of the houseexcept himself, always went to bed at nightfall, so that she might notburn out her candles.', 'Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be quiet.He heard some one ascending the stairs.', 'It might possibly be the oldwoman, who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary’s.Jean Valjean listened.The step was heavy, and sounded like that of a man; but the old womanwore stout shoes, and there is nothing which so strongly resembles thestep of a man as that of an old woman.', 'Nevertheless, Jean Valjean blewout his candle.He had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice, “Get into bedvery softly”; and as he kissed her brow, the steps paused.Jean Valjean remained silent, motionless, with his back towards thedoor, seated on the chair from which he had not stirred, and holdinghis breath in the dark.After the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned round, as heheard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards the door of hischamber, he saw a light through the keyhole.', 'This light formed a sortof sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall.', 'There wasevidently some one there, who was holding a candle in his hand andlistening.Several minutes elapsed thus, and the light retreated.', 'But he heard nosound of footsteps, which seemed to indicate that the person who hadbeen listening at the door had removed his shoes.Jean Valjean threw himself, all dressed as he was, on his bed, andcould not close his eyes all night.At daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, he wasawakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at theend of the corridor, then he heard the same masculine footstep whichhad ascended the stairs on the preceding evening.', 'The step wasapproaching.', 'He sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole,which was tolerably large, hoping to see the person who had made hisway by night into the house and had listened at his door, as he passed.It was a man, in fact, who passed, this time without pausing, in frontof Jean Valjean’s chamber.', 'The corridor was too dark to allow of theperson’s face being distinguished; but when the man reached thestaircase, a ray of light from without made it stand out like asilhouette, and Jean Valjean had a complete view of his back.', 'The manwas of lofty stature, clad in a long frock-coat, with a cudgel underhis arm.', 'The formidable neck and shoulders belonged to Javert.Jean Valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of himthrough his window opening on the boulevard, but he would have beenobliged to open the window: he dared not.It was evident that this man had entered with a key, and like himself.Who had given him that key?', 'What was the meaning of this?When the old woman came to do the work, at seven o’clock in themorning, Jean Valjean cast a penetrating glance on her, but he did notquestion her.', 'The good woman appeared as usual.As she swept up she remarked to him:—“Possibly Monsieur may have heard some one come in last night?”At that age, and on that boulevard, eight o’clock in the evening wasthe dead of the night.“That is true, by the way,” he replied, in the most natural tonepossible.', '“Who was it?”“It was a new lodger who has come into the house,” said the old woman.“And what is his name?”“I don’t know exactly; Dumont, or Daumont, or some name of that sort.”“And who is this Monsieur Dumont?”The old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes, and answered:—“A gentleman of property, like yourself.”Perhaps she had no ulterior meaning.', 'Jean Valjean thought he perceivedone.When the old woman had taken her departure, he did up a hundred francswhich he had in a cupboard, into a roll, and put it in his pocket.', 'Inspite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that hemight not be heard rattling silver, a hundred-sou piece escaped fromhis hands and rolled noisily on the floor.When darkness came on, he descended and carefully scrutinized bothsides of the boulevard.', 'He saw no one.', 'The boulevard appeared to beabsolutely deserted.', 'It is true that a person can conceal himselfbehind trees.He went upstairs again.“Come.” he said to Cosette.He took her by the hand, and they both went out.BOOK FIFTH—FOR A BLACK HUNT, A MUTE PACKCHAPTER I—THE ZIGZAGS OF STRATEGYAn observation here becomes necessary, in view of the pages which thereader is about to peruse, and of others which will be met with furtheron.The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioninghimself, has been absent from Paris for many years.', 'Paris has beentransformed since he quitted it.', 'A new city has arisen, which is, aftera fashion, unknown to him.', 'There is no need for him to say that heloves Paris: Paris is his mind’s natal city.', 'In consequence ofdemolitions and reconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Pariswhich he bore away religiously in his memory, is now a Paris of daysgone by.', 'He must be permitted to speak of that Paris as though it stillexisted.', 'It is possible that when the author conducts his readers to aspot and says, “In such a street there stands such and such a house,”neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality.Readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble.', 'For hisown part, he is unacquainted with the new Paris, and he writes with theold Paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him.', 'Itis a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind himsomething of that which he beheld when he was in his own country, andthat all has not vanished.', 'So long as you go and come in your nativeland, you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference toyou; that those windows, those roofs, and those doors are nothing toyou; that those walls are strangers to you; that those trees are merelythe first encountered haphazard; that those houses, which you do notenter, are useless to you; that the pavements which you tread aremerely stones.', 'Later on, when you are no longer there, you perceivethat the streets are dear to you; that you miss those roofs, thosedoors; and that those walls are necessary to you, those trees are wellbeloved by you; that you entered those houses which you never entered,every day, and that you have left a part of your heart, of your blood,of your soul, in those pavements.', 'All those places which you no longerbehold, which you may never behold again, perchance, and whose memoryyou have cherished, take on a melancholy charm, recur to your mind withthe melancholy of an apparition, make the holy land visible to you, andare, so to speak, the very form of France, and you love them; and youcall them up as they are, as they were, and you persist in this, andyou will submit to no change: for you are attached to the figure ofyour fatherland as to the face of your mother.May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present?', 'Thatsaid, we beg the reader to take note of it, and we continue.Jean Valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into thestreets, taking the most intricate lines which he could devise,returning on his track at times, to make sure that he was not beingfollowed.', 'EnlargeThe Black Hunt  2b5-1-black-huntThis manœuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag.', 'On soil where an imprintof the track may be left, this manœuvre possesses, among otheradvantages, that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs, by throwingthem on the wrong scent.', 'In venery this is called _falsere-imbushment_.The moon was full that night.', 'Jean Valjean was not sorry for this.', 'Themoon, still very close to the horizon, cast great masses of light andshadow in the streets.', 'Jean Valjean could glide along close to thehouses on the dark side, and yet keep watch on the light side.', 'He didnot, perhaps, take sufficiently into consideration the fact that thedark side escaped him.', 'Still, in the deserted lanes which lie near theRue Poliveau, he thought he felt certain that no one was following him.Cosette walked on without asking any questions.', 'The sufferings of thefirst six years of her life had instilled something passive into hernature.', 'Moreover,—and this is a remark to which we shall frequentlyhave occasion to recur,—she had grown used, without being herself awareof it, to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks ofdestiny.', 'And then she was with him, and she felt safe.Jean Valjean knew no more where he was going than did Cosette.', 'Hetrusted in God, as she trusted in him.', 'It seemed as though he also wereclinging to the hand of some one greater than himself; he thought hefelt a being leading him, though invisible.', 'However, he had no settledidea, no plan, no project.', 'He was not even absolutely sure that it wasJavert, and then it might have been Javert, without Javert knowing thathe was Jean Valjean.', 'Was not he disguised?', 'Was not he believed to bedead?', 'Still, queer things had been going on for several days.', 'He wantedno more of them.', 'He was determined not to return to the Gorbeau house.Like the wild animal chased from its lair, he was seeking a hole inwhich he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell.Jean Valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the Mouffetardquarter, which was already asleep, as though the discipline of theMiddle Ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed; he combined invarious manners, with cunning strategy, the Rue Censier and the RueCopeau, the Rue du Battoir-Saint-Victor and the Rue du Puits l’Ermite.There are lodging houses in this locality, but he did not even enterone, finding nothing which suited him.', 'He had no doubt that if any onehad chanced to be upon his track, they would have lost it.As eleven o’clock struck from Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, he was traversingthe Rue de Pontoise, in front of the office of the commissary ofpolice, situated at No.', '14.', 'A few moments later, the instinct of whichwe have spoken above made him turn round.', 'At that moment he sawdistinctly, thanks to the commissary’s lantern, which betrayed them,three men who were following him closely, pass, one after the other,under that lantern, on the dark side of the street.', 'One of the threeentered the alley leading to the commissary’s house.', 'The one whomarched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious.“Come, child,” he said to Cosette; and he made haste to quit the RuePontoise.He took a circuit, turned into the Passage des Patriarches, which wasclosed on account of the hour, strode along the Rue de l‘Épée-de-Boisand the Rue de l’Arbalète, and plunged into the Rue des Postes.At that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets,where the College Rollin stands to-day, and where the RueNeuve-Sainte-Geneviève turns off.It is understood, of course, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève is anold street, and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the Rue desPostes once in ten years.', 'In the thirteenth century this Rue des Posteswas inhabited by potters, and its real name is Rue des Pots.The moon cast a livid light into this open space.', 'Jean Valjean wentinto ambush in a doorway, calculating that if the men were stillfollowing him, he could not fail to get a good look at them, as theytraversed this illuminated space.In point of fact, three minutes had not elapsed when the men made theirappearance.', 'There were four of them now.', 'All were tall, dressed inlong, brown coats, with round hats, and huge cudgels in their hands.Their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarmingthan did their sinister stride through the darkness.', 'One would havepronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois.They halted in the middle of the space and formed a group, like men inconsultation.', 'They had an air of indecision.', 'The one who appeared to betheir leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand inthe direction which Jean Valjean had taken; another seemed to indicatethe contrary direction with considerable obstinacy.', 'At the moment whenthe first man wheeled round, the moon fell full in his face.', 'JeanValjean recognized Javert perfectly.CHAPTER II—IT IS LUCKY THAT THE PONT D’AUSTERLITZ BEARS CARRIAGESUncertainty was at an end for Jean Valjean: fortunately it still lastedfor the men.', 'He took advantage of their hesitation.', 'It was time lostfor them, but gained for him.', 'He slipped from under the gate where hehad concealed himself, and went down the Rue des Postes, towards theregion of the Jardin des Plantes.', 'Cosette was beginning to be tired.', 'Hetook her in his arms and carried her.', 'There were no passers-by, and thestreet lanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon.He redoubled his pace.In a few strides he had reached the Goblet potteries, on the front ofwhich the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancientinscription:—De Goblet fils c’est ici la fabrique;Venez choisir des cruches et des brocs,Des pots à fleurs, des tuyaux, de la brique.A tout venant le Cœur vend des Carreaux.14He left behind him the Rue de la Clef, then the Fountain Saint-Victor,skirted the Jardin des Plantes by the lower streets, and reached thequay.', 'There he turned round.', 'The quay was deserted.', 'The streets weredeserted.', 'There was no one behind him.', 'He drew a long breath.He gained the Pont d’Austerlitz.Tolls were still collected there at that epoch.He presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou.“It is two sous,” said the old soldier in charge of the bridge.', '“Youare carrying a child who can walk.', 'Pay for two.”He paid, vexed that his passage should have aroused remark.', 'Everyflight should be an imperceptible slipping away.A heavy cart was crossing the Seine at the same time as himself, and onits way, like him, to the right bank.', 'This was of use to him.', 'He couldtraverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart.Towards the middle of the Bridge, Cosette, whose feet were benumbed,wanted to walk.', 'He set her on the ground and took her hand again.The bridge once crossed, he perceived some timber-yards on his right.He directed his course thither.', 'In order to reach them, it wasnecessary to risk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered andilluminated space.', 'He did not hesitate.', 'Those who were on his track hadevidently lost the scent, and Jean Valjean believed himself to be outof danger.', 'Hunted, yes; followed, no.A little street, the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, opened outbetween two timber-yards enclosed in walls.', 'This street was dark andnarrow and seemed made expressly for him.', 'Before entering it he cast aglance behind him.From the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the Pontd’Austerlitz.Four shadows were just entering on the bridge.These shadows had their backs turned to the Jardin des Plantes and wereon their way to the right bank.These four shadows were the four men.Jean Valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured.One hope remained to him; it was, that the men had not, perhaps,stepped on the bridge, and had not caught sight of him while he wascrossing the large illuminated space, holding Cosette by the hand.In that case, by plunging into the little street before him, he mightescape, if he could reach the timber-yards, the marshes, themarket-gardens, the uninhabited ground which was not built upon.It seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent littlestreet.', 'He entered it.CHAPTER III—TO WIT, THE PLAN OF PARIS IN 1727Three hundred paces further on, he arrived at a point where the streetforked.', 'It separated into two streets, which ran in a slanting line,one to the right, and the other to the left.Jean Valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a Y.Which should he choose?', 'He did not hesitate, but took the one on theright.Why?Because that to the left ran towards a suburb, that is to say, towardsinhabited regions, and the right branch towards the open country, thatis to say, towards deserted regions.However, they no longer walked very fast.', 'Cosette’s pace retarded JeanValjean’s.He took her up and carried her again.', 'Cosette laid her head on theshoulder of the good man and said not a word.He turned round from time to time and looked behind him.', 'He took careto keep always on the dark side of the street.', 'The street was straightin his rear.', 'The first two or three times that he turned round he sawnothing; the silence was profound, and he continued his march somewhatreassured.', 'All at once, on turning round, he thought he perceived inthe portion of the street which he had just passed through, far off inthe obscurity, something which was moving.He rushed forward precipitately rather than walked, hoping to find someside-street, to make his escape through it, and thus to break his scentonce more.He arrived at a wall.This wall, however, did not absolutely prevent further progress; it wasa wall which bordered a transverse street, in which the one he hadtaken ended.Here again, he was obliged to come to a decision; should he go to theright or to the left.He glanced to the right.', 'The fragmentary lane was prolonged betweenbuildings which were either sheds or barns, then ended at a blindalley.', 'The extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible,—a loftywhite wall.He glanced to the left.', 'On that side the lane was open, and about twohundred paces further on, ran into a street of which it was theaffluent.', 'On that side lay safety.At the moment when Jean Valjean was meditating a turn to the left, inan effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane, heperceived a sort of motionless, black statue at the corner of the laneand the street towards which he was on the point of directing hissteps.It was some one, a man, who had evidently just been posted there, andwho was barring the passage and waiting.Jean Valjean recoiled.The point of Paris where Jean Valjean found himself, situated betweenthe Faubourg Saint-Antoine and la Râpée, is one of those which recentimprovements have transformed from top to bottom,—resulting indisfigurement according to some, and in a transfiguration according toothers.', 'The market-gardens, the timber-yards, and the old buildingshave been effaced.', 'To-day, there are brand-new, wide streets, arenas,circuses, hippodromes, railway stations, and a prison, Mazas, there;progress, as the reader sees, with its antidote.Half a century ago, in that ordinary, popular tongue, which is allcompounded of traditions, which persists in calling the Institut _lesQuatre-Nations_, and the Opera-Comique _Feydeau_, the precise spotwhither Jean Valjean had arrived was called _le Petit-Picpus_.', 'ThePorte Saint-Jacques, the Porte Paris, the Barrière des Sergents, thePorcherons, la Galiote, les Célestins, les Capucins, le Mail, laBourbe, l’Arbre de Cracovie, la Petite-Pologne—these are the names ofold Paris which survive amid the new.', 'The memory of the populace hoversover these relics of the past.Le Petit-Picpus, which, moreover, hardly ever had any existence, andnever was more than the outline of a quarter, had nearly the monkishaspect of a Spanish town.', 'The roads were not much paved; the streetswere not much built up.', 'With the exception of the two or three streets,of which we shall presently speak, all was wall and solitude there.', 'Nota shop, not a vehicle, hardly a candle lighted here and there in thewindows; all lights extinguished after ten o’clock.', 'Gardens, convents,timber-yards, marshes; occasional lowly dwellings and great walls ashigh as the houses.Such was this quarter in the last century.', 'The Revolution snubbed itsoundly.', 'The republican government demolished and cut through it.Rubbish shoots were established there.', 'Thirty years ago, this quarterwas disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings.', 'To-day, ithas been utterly blotted out.', 'The Petit-Picpus, of which no existingplan has preserved a trace, is indicated with sufficient clearness inthe plan of 1727, published at Paris by Denis Thierry, RueSaint-Jacques, opposite the Rue du Plâtre; and at Lyons, by Jean Girin,Rue Mercière, at the sign of Prudence.', 'Petit-Picpus had, as we havejust mentioned, a Y of streets, formed by the Rue duChemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread out in two branches, taking onthe left the name of Little Picpus Street, and on the right the name ofthe Rue Polonceau.', 'The two limbs of the Y were connected at the apex asby a bar; this bar was called Rue Droit-Mur.', 'The Rue Polonceau endedthere; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended towards the Lenoirmarket.', 'A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of the RuePolonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning abruptly ata right angle, in front of him the wall of that street, and on hisright a truncated prolongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had no issueand was called the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.It was here that Jean Valjean stood.As we have just said, on catching sight of that black silhouettestanding on guard at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur and the RuePetit-Picpus, he recoiled.', 'There could be no doubt of it.', 'That phantomwas lying in wait for him.What was he to do?The time for retreating was passed.', 'That which he had perceived inmovement an instant before, in the distant darkness, was Javert and hissquad without a doubt.', 'Javert was probably already at the commencementof the street at whose end Jean Valjean stood.', 'Javert, to allappearances, was acquainted with this little labyrinth, and had takenhis precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit.', 'Thesesurmises, which so closely resembled proofs, whirled suddenly, like ahandful of dust caught up by an unexpected gust of wind, through JeanValjean’s mournful brain.', 'He examined the Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there hewas cut off.', 'He examined the Rue Petit-Picpus; there stood a sentinel.He saw that black form standing out in relief against the whitepavement, illuminated by the moon; to advance was to fall into thisman’s hands; to retreat was to fling himself into Javert’s arms.', 'JeanValjean felt himself caught, as in a net, which was slowly contracting;he gazed heavenward in despair.CHAPTER IV—THE GROPINGS OF FLIGHTIn order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form an exactidea of the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle which oneleaves on the left when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau into thislane.', 'Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right, as faras the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; on the left by asolitary building of severe outlines, composed of numerous parts whichgrew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the RuePetit-Picpus side; so that this building, which was very lofty on theRue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low on the side adjoining the RuePolonceau.', 'There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it descended tosuch a degree that it consisted of merely a wall.', 'This wall did notabut directly on the street; it formed a deeply retreating niche,concealed by its two corners from two observers who might have been,one in the Rue Polonceau, the other in the Rue Droit-Mur.Beginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended along theRue Polonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49, and along theRue Droit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, as far as thegloomy building which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected,thus forming another retreating angle in the street.', 'This gable wassombre of aspect; only one window was visible, or, to speak morecorrectly, two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and keptconstantly closed.The state of the places of which we are here giving a description isrigorously exact, and will certainly awaken a very precise memory inthe mind of old inhabitants of the quarter.The niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal andwretched door; it was a vast, formless assemblage of perpendicularplanks, the upper ones being broader than the lower, bound together bylong transverse strips of iron.', 'At one side there was a carriage gateof the ordinary dimensions, and which had evidently not been cut morethan fifty years previously.A linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, and the wall wascovered with ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau.In the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, this sombrebuilding had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which temptedhim.', 'He ran his eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, that if hecould contrive to get inside it, he might save himself.', 'First heconceived an idea, then a hope.In the central portion of the front of this building, on the RueDroit-Mur side, there were at all the windows of the different storiesancient cistern pipes of lead.', 'The various branches of the pipes whichled from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out asort of tree on the front.', 'These ramifications of pipes with theirhundred elbows imitated those old leafless vine-stocks which writheover the fronts of old farm-houses.This odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was the firstthing that struck Jean Valjean.', 'He seated Cosette with her back againsta stone post, with an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spotwhere the conduit touched the pavement.', 'Perhaps there was some way ofclimbing up by it and entering the house.', 'But the pipe was dilapidatedand past service, and hardly hung to its fastenings.', 'Moreover, all thewindows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars, eventhe attic windows in the roof.', 'And then, the moon fell full upon thatfaçade, and the man who was watching at the corner of the street wouldhave seen Jean Valjean in the act of climbing.', 'And finally, what was tobe done with Cosette?', 'How was she to be drawn up to the top of athree-story house?He gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, and crawledalong the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau.When he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, henoticed that no one could see him there.', 'As we have just explained, hewas concealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction they wereapproaching; besides this, he was in the shadow.', 'Finally, there weretwo doors; perhaps they might be forced.', 'The wall above which he sawthe linden-tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where hecould, at least, hide himself, although there were as yet no leaves onthe trees, and spend the remainder of the night.Time was passing; he must act quickly.He felt over the carriage door, and immediately recognized the factthat it was impracticable outside and in.He approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfullydecrepit; its very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks wererotten; the iron bands—there were only three of them—were rusted.', 'Itseemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm-eatenbarrier.On examining it he found that the door was not a door; it had neitherhinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; the iron bandstraversed it from side to side without any break.', 'Through the crevicesin the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stoneroughly cemented together, which passers-by might still have seen thereten years ago.', 'He was forced to acknowledge with consternation thatthis apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a buildingagainst which it was placed.', 'It was easy to tear off a plank; but then,one found one’s self face to face with a wall.CHAPTER V—WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GAS LANTERNSAt that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at somedistance.', 'Jean Valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street.Seven or eight soldiers, drawn up in a platoon, had just debouched intothe Rue Polonceau.', 'He saw the gleam of their bayonets.', 'They wereadvancing towards him; these soldiers, at whose head he distinguishedJavert’s tall figure, advanced slowly and cautiously.', 'They haltedfrequently; it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of thewalls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys.This was some patrol that Javert had encountered—there could be nomistake as to this surmise—and whose aid he had demanded.Javert’s two acolytes were marching in their ranks.At the rate at which they were marching, and in consideration of thehalts which they were making, it would take them about a quarter of anhour to reach the spot where Jean Valjean stood.', 'It was a frightfulmoment.', 'A few minutes only separated Jean Valjean from that terribleprecipice which yawned before him for the third time.', 'And the galleysnow meant not only the galleys, but Cosette lost to him forever; thatis to say, a life resembling the interior of a tomb.There was but one thing which was possible.Jean Valjean had this peculiarity, that he carried, as one might say,two beggar’s pouches: in one he kept his saintly thoughts; in the otherthe redoubtable talents of a convict.', 'He rummaged in the one or theother, according to circumstances.Among his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes from theprison at Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a past master inthe incredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing-irons, bysheer muscular force, by leaning on the nape of his neck, hisshoulders, his hips, and his knees, by helping himself on the rareprojections of the stone, in the right angle of a wall, as high as thesixth story, if need be; an art which has rendered so celebrated and soalarming that corner of the wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by whichBattemolle, condemned to death, made his escape twenty years ago.Jean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied thelinden; it was about eighteen feet in height.', 'The angle which it formedwith the gable of the large building was filled, at its lowerextremity, by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape, probablyintended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish ofthose dirty creatures called the passers-by.', 'This practice of fillingup corners of the wall is much in use in Paris.This mass was about five feet in height; the space above the summit ofthis mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteenfeet.The wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping.Cosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb a wall.Should he abandon her?', 'Jean Valjean did not once think of that.', 'It wasimpossible to carry her.', 'A man’s whole strength is required tosuccessfully carry out these singular ascents.', 'The least burden woulddisturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards.A rope would have been required; Jean Valjean had none.', 'Where was he toget a rope at midnight, in the Rue Polonceau?', 'Certainly, if JeanValjean had had a kingdom, he would have given it for a rope at thatmoment.All extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimesdazzle, sometimes illuminate us.Jean Valjean’s despairing glance fell on the street lantern-post of theblind alley Genrot.At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris.', 'Atnightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they wereascended and descended by means of a rope, which traversed the streetfrom side to side, and was adjusted in a groove of the post.', 'The pulleyover which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in alittle iron box, the key to which was kept by the lamp-lighter, and therope itself was protected by a metal case.Jean Valjean, with the energy of a supreme struggle, crossed the streetat one bound, entered the blind alley, broke the latch of the littlebox with the point of his knife, and an instant later he was besideCosette once more.', 'He had a rope.', 'These gloomy inventors of expedientswork rapidly when they are fighting against fatality.We have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted thatnight.', 'The lantern in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot was thus naturally extinct,like the rest; and one could pass directly under it without evennoticing that it was no longer in its place.Nevertheless, the hour, the place, the darkness, Jean Valjean’sabsorption, his singular gestures, his goings and comings, all hadbegun to render Cosette uneasy.', 'Any other child than she would havegiven vent to loud shrieks long before.', 'She contented herself withplucking Jean Valjean by the skirt of his coat.', 'They could hear thesound of the patrol’s approach ever more and more distinctly.“Father,” said she, in a very low voice, “I am afraid.', 'Who is comingyonder?”“Hush!” replied the unhappy man; “it is Madame Thénardier.”Cosette shuddered.', 'He added:—“Say nothing.', 'Don’t interfere with me.', 'If you cry out, if you weep, theThénardier is lying in wait for you.', 'She is coming to take you back.”Then, without haste, but without making a useless movement, with firmand curt precision, the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol andJavert might come upon him at any moment, he undid his cravat, passedit round Cosette’s body under the armpits, taking care that it shouldnot hurt the child, fastened this cravat to one end of the rope, bymeans of that knot which seafaring men call a “swallow knot,” took theother end of the rope in his teeth, pulled off his shoes and stockings,which he threw over the wall, stepped upon the mass of masonry, andbegan to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with asmuch solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladderunder his feet and elbows.', 'Half a minute had not elapsed when he wasresting on his knees on the wall.Cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement, without uttering a word.', 'JeanValjean’s injunction, and the name of Madame Thénardier, had chilledher blood.All at once she heard Jean Valjean’s voice crying to her, though in avery low tone:—“Put your back against the wall.”She obeyed.“Don’t say a word, and don’t be alarmed,” went on Jean Valjean.And she felt herself lifted from the ground.Before she had time to recover herself, she was on the top of the wall.Jean Valjean grasped her, put her on his back, took her two tiny handsin his large left hand, lay down flat on his stomach and crawled alongon top of the wall as far as the cant.', 'As he had guessed, there stood abuilding whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade anddescended to within a very short distance of the ground, with a gentleslope which grazed the linden-tree.', 'A lucky circumstance, for the wallwas much higher on this side than on the street side.', 'Jean Valjeancould only see the ground at a great depth below him.He had just reached the slope of the roof, and had not yet left thecrest of the wall, when a violent uproar announced the arrival of thepatrol.', 'The thundering voice of Javert was audible:—“Search the blind alley!', 'The Rue Droit-Mur is guarded!', 'so is the RuePetit-Picpus.', 'I’ll answer for it that he is in the blind alley.”The soldiers rushed into the Genrot alley.Jean Valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof, still holding fastto Cosette, reached the linden-tree, and leaped to the ground.', 'Whetherfrom terror or courage, Cosette had not breathed a sound, though herhands were a little abraded.CHAPTER VI—THE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMAJean Valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast andof singular aspect; one of those melancholy gardens which seem made tobe looked at in winter and at night.', 'This garden was oblong in shape,with an alley of large poplars at the further end, tolerably tallforest trees in the corners, and an unshaded space in the centre, wherecould be seen a very large, solitary tree, then several fruit-trees,gnarled and bristling like bushes, beds of vegetables, a melon patch,whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight, and an old well.', 'Here andthere stood stone benches which seemed black with moss.', 'The alleys werebordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs.', 'The grass had halftaken possession of them, and a green mould covered the rest.Jean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as ameans of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, directlyagainst the wall, a stone statue, whose mutilated face was no longeranything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through thegloom.The building was a sort of ruin, where dismantled chambers weredistinguishable, one of which, much encumbered, seemed to serve as ashed.The large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing on the RuePetit-Picpus, turned two façades, at right angles, towards this garden.These interior façades were even more tragic than the exterior.', 'All thewindows were grated.', 'Not a gleam of light was visible at any one ofthem.', 'The upper story had scuttles like prisons.', 'One of those façadescast its shadow on the other, which fell over the garden like animmense black pall.No other house was visible.', 'The bottom of the garden was lost in mistand darkness.', 'Nevertheless, walls could be confusedly made out, whichintersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond, and thelow roofs of the Rue Polonceau.Nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined.There was no one in it, which was quite natural in view of the hour;but it did not seem as though this spot were made for any one to walkin, even in broad daylight.Jean Valjean’s first care had been to get hold of his shoes and putthem on again, then to step under the shed with Cosette.', 'A man who isfleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden.', 'The child, whosethoughts were still on the Thénardier, shared his instinct forwithdrawing from sight as much as possible.Cosette trembled and pressed close to him.', 'They heard the tumultuousnoise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets; theblows of their gun-stocks against the stones; Javert’s appeals to thepolice spies whom he had posted, and his imprecations mingled withwords which could not be distinguished.At the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though thatspecies of stormy roar were becoming more distant.', 'Jean Valjean heldhis breath.He had laid his hand lightly on Cosette’s mouth.However, the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm, thatthis frightful uproar, close and furious as it was, did not disturb himby so much as the shadow of a misgiving.', 'It seemed as though thosewalls had been built of the deaf stones of which the Scriptures speak.All at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; asound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had beenhorrible.', 'It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burstof prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night;women’s voices, but voices composed at one and the same time of thepure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children,—voiceswhich are not of the earth, and which resemble those that the newborninfant still hears, and which the dying man hears already.', 'This songproceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden.', 'Atthe moment when the hubbub of demons retreated, one would have saidthat a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom.Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees.They knew not what it was, they knew not where they were; but both ofthem, the man and the child, the penitent and the innocent, felt thatthey must kneel.These voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not preventthe building from seeming to be deserted.', 'It was a supernatural chantin an uninhabited house.While these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing.', 'He nolonger beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky.', 'It seemed to him that hefelt those wings which we all have within us, unfolding.The song died away.', 'It may have lasted a long time.', 'Jean Valjean couldnot have told.', 'Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment.All fell silent again.', 'There was no longer anything in the street;there was nothing in the garden.', 'That which had menaced, that which hadreassured him,—all had vanished.', 'The breeze swayed a few dry weeds onthe crest of the wall, and they gave out a faint, sweet, melancholysound.CHAPTER VII—CONTINUATION OF THE ENIGMAThe night wind had risen, which indicated that it must be between oneand two o’clock in the morning.', 'Poor Cosette said nothing.', 'As she hadseated herself beside him and leaned her head against him, Jean Valjeanhad fancied that she was asleep.', 'He bent down and looked at her.Cosette’s eyes were wide open, and her thoughtful air pained JeanValjean.She was still trembling.“Are you sleepy?” said Jean Valjean.“I am very cold,” she replied.A moment later she resumed:—“Is she still there?”“Who?” said Jean Valjean.“Madame Thénardier.”Jean Valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed tomake Cosette keep silent.“Ah!” said he, “she is gone.', 'You need fear nothing further.”The child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast.The ground was damp, the shed open on all sides, the breeze grew morekeen every instant.', 'The goodman took off his coat and wrapped it roundCosette.“Are you less cold now?” said he.“Oh, yes, father.”“Well, wait for me a moment.', 'I will soon be back.”He quitted the ruin and crept along the large building, seeking abetter shelter.', 'He came across doors, but they were closed.', 'There werebars at all the windows of the ground floor.Just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he observedthat he was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived a light.He stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows.', 'They allopened on a tolerably vast hall, paved with large flagstones, cut up byarcades and pillars, where only a tiny light and great shadows werevisible.', 'The light came from a taper which was burning in one corner.The apartment was deserted, and nothing was stirring in it.Nevertheless, by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on theground something which appeared to be covered with a winding-sheet, andwhich resembled a human form.', 'This form was lying face downward, flaton the pavement, with the arms extended in the form of a cross, in theimmobility of death.', 'One would have said, judging from a sort ofserpent which undulated over the floor, that this sinister form had arope round its neck.The whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparelyilluminated, which adds to horror.Jean Valjean often said afterwards, that, although many funerealspectres had crossed his path in life, he had never beheld anythingmore blood-curdling and terrible than that enigmatical formaccomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place, andbeheld thus at night.', 'It was alarming to suppose that that thing wasperhaps dead; and still more alarming to think that it was perhapsalive.He had the courage to plaster his face to the glass, and to watchwhether the thing would move.', 'In spite of his remaining thus whatseemed to him a very long time, the outstretched form made no movement.All at once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror, andhe fled.', 'He began to run towards the shed, not daring to look behindhim.', 'It seemed to him, that if he turned his head, he should see thatform following him with great strides and waving its arms.He reached the ruin all out of breath.', 'His knees were giving waybeneath him; the perspiration was pouring from him.Where was he?', 'Who could ever have imagined anything like that sort ofsepulchre in the midst of Paris!', 'What was this strange house?', 'Anedifice full of nocturnal mystery, calling to souls through thedarkness with the voice of angels, and when they came, offering themabruptly that terrible vision; promising to open the radiant portals ofheaven, and then opening the horrible gates of the tomb!', 'And itactually was an edifice, a house, which bore a number on the street!', 'Itwas not a dream!', 'He had to touch the stones to convince himself thatsuch was the fact.Cold, anxiety, uneasiness, the emotions of the night, had given him agenuine fever, and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain.He stepped up to Cosette.', 'She was asleep.CHAPTER VIII—THE ENIGMA BECOMES DOUBLY MYSTERIOUSThe child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep.He sat down beside her and began to think.', 'Little by little, as hegazed at her, he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom ofmind.He clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth,that so long as she was there, so long as he had her near him, heshould need nothing except for her, he should fear nothing except forher.', 'He was not even conscious that he was very cold, since he hadtaken off his coat to cover her.Nevertheless, athwart this reverie into which he had fallen he hadheard for some time a peculiar noise.', 'It was like the tinkling of abell.', 'This sound proceeded from the garden.', 'It could be hearddistinctly though faintly.', 'It resembled the faint, vague music producedby the bells of cattle at night in the pastures.This noise made Valjean turn round.He looked and saw that there was some one in the garden.A being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the melonbeds, rising, stooping, halting, with regular movements, as though hewere dragging or spreading out something on the ground.', 'This personappeared to limp.Jean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy.', 'Forthem everything is hostile and suspicious.', 'They distrust the daybecause it enables people to see them, and the night because it aids insurprising them.', 'A little while before he had shivered because thegarden was deserted, and now he shivered because there was some onethere.He fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors.', 'He said tohimself that Javert and the spies had, perhaps, not taken theirdeparture; that they had, no doubt, left people on the watch in thestreet; that if this man should discover him in the garden, he wouldcry out for help against thieves and deliver him up.', 'He took thesleeping Cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap ofold furniture, which was out of use, in the most remote corner of theshed.', 'Cosette did not stir.From that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melonpatch.', 'The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the bellfollowed each of this man’s movements.', 'When the man approached, thesound approached; when the man retreated, the sound retreated; if hemade any hasty gesture, a tremolo accompanied the gesture; when hehalted, the sound ceased.', 'It appeared evident that the bell wasattached to that man; but what could that signify?', 'Who was this man whohad a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox?As he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette’s hands.', 'Theywere icy cold.“Ah!', 'good God!” he cried.He spoke to her in a low voice:—“Cosette!”She did not open her eyes.He shook her vigorously.She did not wake.“Is she dead?” he said to himself, and sprang to his feet, quiveringfrom head to foot.The most frightful thoughts rushed pell-mell through his mind.', 'Thereare moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies,and violently force the partitions of our brains.', 'When those we loveare in question, our prudence invents every sort of madness.', 'Heremembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal.Cosette was pale, and had fallen at full length on the ground at hisfeet, without a movement.He listened to her breathing: she still breathed, but with arespiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction.How was he to warm her back to life?', 'How was he to rouse her?', 'All thatwas not connected with this vanished from his thoughts.', 'He rushedwildly from the ruin.It was absolutely necessary that Cosette should be in bed and beside afire in less than a quarter of an hour.CHAPTER IX—THE MAN WITH THE BELLHe walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden.', 'He hadtaken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of hiswaistcoat.The man’s head was bent down, and he did not see him approaching.', 'In afew strides Jean Valjean stood beside him.Jean Valjean accosted him with the cry:—“One hundred francs!”The man gave a start and raised his eyes.“You can earn a hundred francs,” went on Jean Valjean, “if you willgrant me shelter for this night.”The moon shone full upon Jean Valjean’s terrified countenance.“What!', 'so it is you, Father Madeleine!” said the man.That name, thus pronounced, at that obscure hour, in that unknown spot,by that strange man, made Jean Valjean start back.He had expected anything but that.', 'The person who thus addressed himwas a bent and lame old man, dressed almost like a peasant, who wore onhis left knee a leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately large bell.His face, which was in the shadow, was not distinguishable.However, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling allover:—“Ah, good God!', 'How come you here, Father Madeleine?', 'Where did youenter?', 'Dieu-Jésus!', 'Did you fall from heaven?', 'There is no trouble aboutthat: if ever you do fall, it will be from there.', 'And what a state youare in!', 'You have no cravat; you have no hat; you have no coat!', 'Do youknow, you would have frightened any one who did not know you?', 'No coat!Lord God!', 'Are the saints going mad nowadays?', 'But how did you get inhere?”His words tumbled over each other.', 'The goodman talked with a rusticvolubility, in which there was nothing alarming.', 'All this was utteredwith a mixture of stupefaction and _naïve_ kindliness.“Who are you?', 'and what house is this?” demanded Jean Valjean.“Ah!', 'pardieu, this is too much!” exclaimed the old man.', '“I am theperson for whom you got the place here, and this house is the one whereyou had me placed.', 'What!', 'You don’t recognize me?”“No,” said Jean Valjean; “and how happens it that you know me?”“You saved my life,” said the man.He turned.', 'A ray of moonlight outlined his profile, and Jean Valjeanrecognized old Fauchelevent.“Ah!” said Jean Valjean, “so it is you?', 'Yes, I recollect you.”“That is very lucky,” said the old man, in a reproachful tone.“And what are you doing here?” resumed Jean Valjean.“Why, I am covering my melons, of course!”In fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old Faucheleventheld in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied inspreading over the melon bed.', 'During the hour or thereabouts that hehad been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them.', 'Itwas this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiarmovements observed from the shed by Jean Valjean.He continued:—“I said to myself, ‘The moon is bright: it is going to freeze.', 'What ifI were to put my melons into their greatcoats?’ And,” he added, lookingat Jean Valjean with a broad smile,—“pardieu!', 'you ought to have donethe same!', 'But how do you come here?”Jean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least only underthe name of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with caution.', 'Hemultiplied his questions.', 'Strange to say, their rôles seemed to bereversed.', 'It was he, the intruder, who interrogated.“And what is this bell which you wear on your knee?”“This,” replied Fauchelevent, “is so that I may be avoided.”“What!', 'so that you may be avoided?”Old Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air.“Ah, goodness!', 'there are only women in this house—many young girls.', 'Itappears that I should be a dangerous person to meet.', 'The bell givesthem warning.', 'When I come, they go.”“What house is this?”“Come, you know well enough.”“But I do not.”“Not when you got me the place here as gardener?”“Answer me as though I knew nothing.”“Well, then, this is the Petit-Picpus convent.”Memories recurred to Jean Valjean.', 'Chance, that is to say, Providence,had cast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoinewhere old Fauchelevent, crippled by the fall from his cart, had beenadmitted on his recommendation two years previously.', 'He repeated, asthough talking to himself:—“The Petit-Picpus convent.”“Exactly,” returned old Fauchelevent.', '“But to come to the point, howthe deuce did you manage to get in here, you, Father Madeleine?', 'Nomatter if you are a saint; you are a man as well, and no man entershere.”“You certainly are here.”“There is no one but me.”“Still,” said Jean Valjean, “I must stay here.”“Ah, good God!” cried Fauchelevent.Jean Valjean drew near to the old man, and said to him in a gravevoice:—“Father Fauchelevent, I saved your life.”“I was the first to recall it,” returned Fauchelevent.“Well, you can do to-day for me that which I did for you in the oldendays.”Fauchelevent took in his aged, trembling, and wrinkled hands JeanValjean’s two robust hands, and stood for several minutes as thoughincapable of speaking.', 'At length he exclaimed:—“Oh!', 'that would be a blessing from the good God, if I could make yousome little return for that!', 'Save your life!', 'Monsieur le Maire, disposeof the old man!”A wonderful joy had transfigured this old man.', 'His countenance seemedto emit a ray of light.“What do you wish me to do?” he resumed.“That I will explain to you.', 'You have a chamber?”“I have an isolated hovel yonder, behind the ruins of the old convent,in a corner which no one ever looks into.', 'There are three rooms in it.”The hut was, in fact, so well hidden behind the ruins, and so cleverlyarranged to prevent it being seen, that Jean Valjean had not perceivedit.“Good,” said Jean Valjean.', '“Now I am going to ask two things of you.”“What are they, Mr. Mayor?”“In the first place, you are not to tell any one what you know aboutme.', 'In the second, you are not to try to find out anything more.”“As you please.', 'I know that you can do nothing that is not honest, thatyou have always been a man after the good God’s heart.', 'And then,moreover, you it was who placed me here.', 'That concerns you.', 'I am atyour service.”“That is settled then.', 'Now, come with me.', 'We will go and get thechild.”“Ah!” said Fauchelevent, “so there is a child?”He added not a word further, and followed Jean Valjean as a dog followshis master.Less than half an hour afterwards Cosette, who had grown rosy againbefore the flame of a good fire, was lying asleep in the old gardener’sbed.', 'Jean Valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more; his hat,which he had flung over the wall, had been found and picked up.', 'WhileJean Valjean was putting on his coat, Fauchelevent had removed the belland kneecap, which now hung on a nail beside a vintage basket thatadorned the wall.', 'The two men were warming themselves with their elbowsresting on a table upon which Fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese,black bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the old man wassaying to Jean Valjean, as he laid his hand on the latter’s knee: “Ah!Father Madeleine!', 'You did not recognize me immediately; you savepeople’s lives, and then you forget them!', 'That is bad!', 'But theyremember you!', 'You are an ingrate!”CHAPTER X—WHICH EXPLAINS HOW JAVERT GOT ON THE SCENTThe events of which we have just beheld the reverse side, so to speak,had come about in the simplest possible manner.When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert hadarrested him beside Fantine’s death-bed, had escaped from the town jailof M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself toParis.', 'Paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost, and everythingdisappears in this belly of the world, as in the belly of the sea.', 'Noforest hides a man as does that crowd.', 'Fugitives of

Guillaume Lambert.”Lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name.', 'ThereuponJavert returned to Paris.“Jean Valjean is certainly dead,” said he, “and I am a ninny.”He had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course ofMarch, 1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parishof Saint-Médard and who had been surnamed “the mendicant who givesalms.” This person, the story ran, was a man of means, whose name noone knew exactly, and who lived alone with a little girl of eightyears, who knew nothing about herself, save that she had come fromMontfermeil.', 'Montfermeil!', 'that name was always coming up, and it madeJavert prick up his ears.', 'An old beggar police spy, an ex-beadle, towhom this person had given alms, added a few more details.', 'Thisgentleman of property was very shy,—never coming out except in theevening, speaking to no one, except, occasionally to the poor, andnever allowing any one to approach him.', 'He wore a horrible old yellowfrock-coat, which was worth many millions, being all wadded withbank-bills.', 'This piqued Javert’s curiosity in a decided manner.', 'Inorder to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarminghim, he borrowed the beadle’s outfit for a day, and the place where theold spy was in the habit of crouching every evening, whining orisonsthrough his nose, and playing the spy under cover of prayer.“The suspected individual” did indeed approach Javert thus disguised,and bestow alms on him.', 'At that moment Javert raised his head, and theshock which Jean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was equal tothe one received by Javert when he thought he recognized Jean Valjean.However, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean’s death wasofficial; Javert cherished very grave doubts; and when in doubt,Javert, the man of scruples, never laid a finger on any one’s collar.He followed his man to the Gorbeau house, and got “the old woman” totalking, which was no difficult matter.', 'The old woman confirmed thefact regarding the coat lined with millions, and narrated to him theepisode of the thousand-franc bill.', 'She had seen it!', 'She had handledit!', 'Javert hired a room; that evening he installed himself in it.', 'Hecame and listened at the mysterious lodger’s door, hoping to catch thesound of his voice, but Jean Valjean saw his candle through thekey-hole, and foiled the spy by keeping silent.On the following day Jean Valjean decamped; but the noise made by thefall of the five-franc piece was noticed by the old woman, who, hearingthe rattling of coin, suspected that he might be intending to leave,and made haste to warn Javert.', 'At night, when Jean Valjean came out,Javert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with twomen.Javert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had notmentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; that washis secret, and he had kept it for three reasons: in the first place,because the slightest indiscretion might put Jean Valjean on the alert;next, because, to lay hands on an ex-convict who had made his escapeand was reputed dead, on a criminal whom justice had formerly classedforever as _among malefactors of the most dangerous sort_, was amagnificent success which the old members of the Parisian police wouldassuredly not leave to a newcomer like Javert, and he was afraid ofbeing deprived of his convict; and lastly, because Javert, being anartist, had a taste for the unforeseen.', 'He hated those well-heraldedsuccesses which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloombrushed off.', 'He preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark andto unveil them suddenly at the last.Javert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from corner tocorner of the street, and had not lost sight of him for a singleinstant; even at the moments when Jean Valjean believed himself to bethe most secure Javert’s eye had been on him.', 'Why had not Javertarrested Jean Valjean?', 'Because he was still in doubt.It must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not preciselyat its ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrestsdenounced by the newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers,and had rendered the Prefecture timid.', 'Interference with individualliberty was a grave matter.', 'The police agents were afraid of making amistake; the prefect laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal.The reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph,reproduced by twenty newspapers, would have caused in Paris:“Yesterday, an aged grandfather, with white hair, a respectable andwell-to-do gentleman, who was walking with his grandchild, aged eight,was arrested and conducted to the agency of the Prefecture as anescaped convict!”Let us repeat in addition that Javert had scruples of his own;injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of theprefect.', 'He was really in doubt.Jean Valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark.Sadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune ofbeing forced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris forCosette and himself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the paceof the child—all this, without his being aware of it, had altered JeanValjean’s walk, and impressed on his bearing such senility, that thepolice themselves, incarnate in the person of Javert, might, and did infact, make a mistake.', 'The impossibility of approaching too close, hiscostume of an _émigré_ preceptor, the declaration of Thénardier whichmade a grandfather of him, and, finally, the belief in his death inprison, added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick inJavert’s mind.For an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for hispapers; but if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this man was not agood, honest old fellow living on his income, he was probably somemerry blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web ofParisian misdeeds, some chief of a dangerous band, who gave alms toconceal his other talents, which was an old dodge.', 'He had trustyfellows, accomplices’ retreats in case of emergencies, in which hewould, no doubt, take refuge.', 'All these turns which he was makingthrough the streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple andhonest man.', 'To arrest him too hastily would be “to kill the hen thatlaid the golden eggs.” Where was the inconvenience in waiting?', 'Javertwas very sure that he would not escape.Thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind, putting tohimself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage.It was only quite late in the Rue de Pontoise, that, thanks to thebrilliant light thrown from a dram-shop, he decidedly recognized JeanValjean.There are in this world two beings who give a profound start,—themother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey.Javert gave that profound start.As soon as he had positively recognized Jean Valjean, the formidableconvict, he perceived that there were only three of them, and he askedfor reinforcements at the police station of the Rue de Pontoise.', 'Oneputs on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel.This delay and the halt at the Carrefour Rollin to consult with hisagents came near causing him to lose the trail.', 'He speedily divined,however, that Jean Valjean would want to put the river between hispursuers and himself.', 'He bent his head and reflected like a blood-houndwho puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the rightscent.', 'Javert, with his powerful rectitude of instinct, went straightto the bridge of Austerlitz.', 'A word with the toll-keeper furnished himwith the information which he required: “Have you seen a man with alittle girl?” “I made him pay two sous,” replied the toll-keeper.Javert reached the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse thesmall illuminated spot on the other side of the water, leading Cosetteby the hand.', 'He saw him enter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; heremembered the Cul-de-Sac Genrot arranged there like a trap, and of thesole exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpus.', '_He made sureof his back burrows_, as huntsmen say; he hastily despatched one of hisagents, by a roundabout way, to guard that issue.', 'A patrol which wasreturning to the Arsenal post having passed him, he made a requisitionon it, and caused it to accompany him.', 'In such games soldiers are aces.Moreover, the principle is, that in order to get the best of a wildboar, one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs.', 'Thesecombinations having been effected, feeling that Jean Valjean was caughtbetween the blind alley Genrot on the right, his agent on the left, andhimself, Javert, in the rear, he took a pinch of snuff.Then he began the game.', 'He experienced one ecstatic and infernalmoment; he allowed his man to go on ahead, knowing that he had himsafe, but desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long aspossible, happy at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing himfree, gloating over him with his gaze, with that voluptuousness of thespider which allows the fly to flutter, and of the cat which lets themouse run.', 'Claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality,—the obscuremovements of the creature imprisoned in their pincers.', 'What a delightthis strangling is!Javert was enjoying himself.', 'The meshes of his net were stoutlyknotted.', 'He was sure of success;

that is tosay, he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels, and thenthe oldest huntsmen know not what to say.', 'Duvivier, Ligniville, andDesprez halt short.', 'In a discomfiture of this sort, Artonge exclaims,“It was not a stag, but a sorcerer.” Javert would have liked to utterthe same cry.His disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage.It is certain that Napoleon made mistakes during the war with Russia,that Alexander committed blunders in the war in India, that Cæsar mademistakes in the war in Africa, that Cyrus was at fault in the war inScythia, and that Javert blundered in this campaign against JeanValjean.', 'He was wrong, perhaps, in hesitating in his recognition of theexconvict.', 'The first glance should have sufficed him.', 'He was wrong innot arresting him purely and simply in the old building;

a regular box, with its front just of a height to leanupon, bearing a tablet of black wood.', 'This box was grated, only thegrating of it was not of gilded wood, as at the opera; it was amonstrous lattice of iron bars, hideously interlaced and riveted to thewall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists.The first minutes passed;

there was alight; there was life in the midst of that death.', 'Although this was themost strictly walled of all convents, we shall endeavor to make our wayinto it, and to take the reader in, and to say, without transgressingthe proper bounds, things which story-tellers have never seen, andhave, therefore, never described.CHAPTER II—THE OBEDIENCE OF MARTIN VERGAThis convent, which in 1824 had already existed for many a long year inthe Rue Petit-Picpus, was a community of Bernardines of the obedienceof Martin Verga.These Bernardines were attached, in consequence, not to Clairvaux, likethe Bernardine monks, but to Cîteaux, like the Benedictine monks.', 'Inother words, they were the subjects, not of Saint Bernard, but of SaintBenoît.Any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that MartinVerga founded in 1425 a congregation of Bernardines-Benedictines, withSalamanca for the head of the order, and Alcala as the branchestablishment.This congregation had sent out branches throughout all the Catholiccountries of Europe.There is nothing unusual in the Latin Church in these grafts of oneorder on another.', 'To mention only a single order of Saint-Benoît, whichis here in question: there are attached to this order, without countingthe obedience of Martin Verga, four congregations,—two in Italy,Mont-Cassin and Sainte-Justine of Padua; two in France, Cluny andSaint-Maur; and nine orders,—Vallombrosa, Granmont, the Célestins, theCamaldules, the Carthusians, the Humiliés, the Olivateurs, theSilvestrins, and lastly, Cîteaux; for Cîteaux itself, a trunk for otherorders, is only an offshoot of Saint-Benoît.', 'Cîteaux dates from SaintRobert, Abbé de Molesme, in the diocese of Langres, in 1098.', 'Now it wasin 529 that the devil, having retired to the desert of Subiaco—he wasold—had he turned hermit?—was chased from the ancient temple of Apollo,where he dwelt, by Saint-Benoît, then aged seventeen.After the rule of the Carmelites, who go barefoot, wear a bit of willowon their throats, and never sit down, the harshest rule is that of theBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga.', 'They are clothed in black,with a guimpe, which, in accordance with the express command ofSaint-Benoît, mounts to the chin.', 'A robe of serge with large sleeves, alarge woollen veil, the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square onthe breast, the band which descends over their brow to their eyes,—thisis their dress.', 'All is black except the band, which is white.', 'Thenovices wear the same habit, but all in white.', 'The professed nuns alsowear a rosary at their side.The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the PerpetualAdoration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,who, at the beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,—one atthe Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève.', 'However, theBernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking,were a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,cloistered in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève and at the Temple.', 'Therewere numerous differences in their rule; there were some in theircostume.', 'The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus wore theblack guimpe, and the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and of the RueNeuve-Sainte-Geneviève wore a white one, and had, besides, on theirbreasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver gilt orgilded copper.', 'The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this HolySacrament.', 'The Perpetual Adoration, which was common to the house ofthe Petit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, leaves those twoorders perfectly distinct.', 'Their only resemblance lies in this practiceof the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament and the Bernardines of MartinVerga, just as there existed a similarity in the study and theglorification of all the mysteries relating to the infancy, the life,and death of Jesus Christ and the Virgin, between the two orders, whichwere, nevertheless, widely separated, and on occasion even hostile.', 'TheOratory of Italy, established at Florence by Philip de Neri, and theOratory of France, established by Pierre de Bérulle.', 'The Oratory ofFrance claimed the precedence, since Philip de Neri was only a saint,while Bérulle was a cardinal.Let us return to the harsh Spanish rule of Martin Verga.The Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience fast all the year round,abstain from meat, fast in Lent and on many other days which arepeculiar to them, rise from their first sleep, from one to threeo’clock in the morning, to read their breviary and chant matins, sleepin all seasons between serge sheets and on straw, make no use of thebath, never light a fire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe therule of silence, speak to each other only during the recreation hours,which are very brief, and wear drugget chemises for six months in theyear, from September 14th, which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross,until Easter.', 'These six months are a modification: the rule says allthe year, but this drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer,produced fevers and nervous spasms.', 'The use of it had to be restricted.Even with this palliation, when the nuns put on this chemise on the14th of September, they suffer from fever for three or four days.Obedience, poverty, chastity, perseverance in their seclusion,—theseare their vows, which the rule greatly aggravates.The prioress is elected for three years by the mothers, who are called_mères vocales_ because they have a voice in the chapter.', 'A prioresscan only be re-elected twice, which fixes the longest possible reign ofa prioress at nine years.They never see the officiating priest, who is always hidden from themby a serge curtain nine feet in height.', 'During the sermon, when thepreacher is in the chapel, they drop their veils over their faces.', 'Theymust always speak low, walk with their eyes on the ground and theirheads bowed.', 'One man only is allowed to enter the convent,—thearchbishop of the diocese.There is really one other,—the gardener.', 'But he is always an old man,and, in order that he may always be alone in the garden, and that thenuns may be warned to avoid him, a bell is attached to his knee.Their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive.', 'It is thecanonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation.', 'As at thevoice of Christ, _ut voci Christi_, at a gesture, at the first sign,_ad nutum, ad primum signum_, immediately, with cheerfulness, withperseverance, with a certain blind obedience, _prompte, hilariter,perseveranter et cæca quadam obedientia_, as the file in the hand ofthe workman, _quasi limam in manibus fabri_, without power to read orto write without express permission, _legere vel scribere nonaddiscerit sine expressa superioris licentia_.Each one of them in turn makes what they call _reparation_.', 'Thereparation is the prayer for all the sins, for all the faults, for allthe dissensions, for all the violations, for all the iniquities, forall the crimes committed on earth.', 'For the space of twelve consecutivehours, from four o’clock in the afternoon till four o’clock in themorning, or from four o’clock in the morning until four o’clock in theafternoon, the sister who is making _reparation_ remains on her kneeson the stone before the Holy Sacrament, with hands clasped, a ropearound her neck.', 'When her fatigue becomes unendurable, she prostratesherself flat on her face against the earth, with her arms outstretchedin the form of a cross;

and one sometimessays _forever_ before the other has had time to say the rather longsentence, “Praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar.”Among the Visitandines the one who enters says: “Ave Maria,” and theone whose cell is entered says, “Gratia plena.” It is their way ofsaying good day, which is in fact full of grace.At each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from thechurch bell of the convent.', 'At this signal prioress, vocal mothers,professed nuns, lay-sisters, novices, postulants, interrupt what theyare saying, what they are doing, or what they are thinking, and all sayin unison if it is five o’clock, for instance, “At five o’clock and atall hours praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!”If it is eight o’clock, “At eight o’clock and at all hours!” and so on,according to the hour.This custom, the object of which is to break the thread of thought andto lead it back constantly to God, exists in many communities; theformula alone varies.', 'Thus at The Infant Jesus they say, “At this hourand at every hour may the love of Jesus kindle my heart!” TheBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga, cloistered fifty years ago atPetit-Picpus, chant the offices to a solemn psalmody, a pure Gregorianchant, and always with full voice during the whole course of theoffice.', 'Everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause,and say in a low voice, “Jesus-Marie-Joseph.” For the office of thedead they adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardlydescend to such a depth.', 'The effect produced is striking and tragic.The nuns of the Petit-Picpus had made a vault under their grand altarfor the burial of their community.', '_The Government_, as they say, doesnot permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent whenthey die.', 'This is an affliction to them, and causes them consternationas an infraction of the rules.They had obtained a mediocre consolation at best,—permission to beinterred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancientVaugirard cemetery, which was made of land which had formerly belongedto their community.On Fridays the nuns hear high mass, vespers, and all the offices, as onSunday.', 'They scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivalsunknown to people of the world, of which the Church of France was soprodigal in the olden days, and of which it is still prodigal in Spainand Italy.', 'Their stations in the chapel are interminable.', 'As for thenumber and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea ofthem than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them: “The prayersof the postulants are frightful, the prayers of the novices are stillworse, and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse.”Once a week the chapter assembles: the prioress presides; the vocalmothers assist.', 'Each sister kneels in turn on the stones, and confessesaloud, in the presence of all, the faults and sins which she hascommitted during the week.', 'The vocal mothers consult after eachconfession and inflict the penance aloud.Besides this confession in a loud tone, for which all faults in theleast serious are reserved, they have for their venial offences whatthey call the _coulpe.', 'To make one’s coulpe_ means to prostrate one’sself flat on one’s face during the office in front of the prioressuntil the latter, who is never called anything but _our mother_,notifies the culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood ofher stall that she can rise.', 'The _coulpe_ or _peccavi_, is made for avery small matter—a broken glass, a torn veil, an involuntary delay ofa few seconds at an office, a false note in church, etc.', '; thissuffices, and the _coulpe_ is made.', 'The _coulpe_ is entirelyspontaneous; it is the culpable person herself (the word isetymologically in its place here) who judges herself and inflicts it onherself.', 'On festival days and Sundays four mother precentors intone theoffices before a large reading-desk with four places.', 'One day one ofthe mother precentors intoned a psalm beginning with _Ecce_, andinstead of _Ecce_ she uttered aloud the three notes _do si sol_; forthis piece of absent-mindedness she underwent a _coulpe_ which lastedduring the whole service: what rendered the fault enormous was the factthat the chapter had laughed.When a nun is summoned to the parlor, even were it the prioressherself, she drops her veil, as will be remembered, so that only hermouth is visible.The prioress alone can hold communication with strangers.', 'The otherscan see only their immediate family, and that very rarely.', 'If, bychance, an outsider presents herself to see a nun, or one whom she hasknown and loved in the outer world, a regular series of negotiations isrequired.', 'If it is a woman, the authorization may sometimes be granted;the nun comes, and they talk to her through the shutters, which areopened only for a mother or sister.', 'It is unnecessary to say thatpermission is always refused to men.Such is the rule of Saint-Benoît, aggravated by Martin Verga.These nuns are not gay, rosy, and fresh, as the daughters of otherorders often are.', 'They are pale and grave.', 'Between 1825 and 1830 threeof them went mad.CHAPTER III—AUSTERITIESOne is a postulant for two years at least, often for four;

and lastly, what wascalled the Little Convent.', 'It was a building with a garden, in whichlived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders, the relics of cloistersdestroyed in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, gray, andwhite medleys of all communities and all possible varieties; what mightbe called, if such a coupling of words is permissible, a sort ofharlequin convent.When the Empire was established, all these poor old dispersed andexiled women had been accorded permission to come and take shelterunder the wings of the Bernardines-Benedictines.', 'The government paidthem a small pension, the ladies of the Petit-Picpus received themcordially.', 'It was a singular pell-mell.', 'Each followed her own rule.Sometimes the pupils of the boarding-school were allowed, as a greatrecreation, to pay them a visit; the result is, that all those youngmemories have retained among other souvenirs that of MotherSainte-Bazile, Mother Sainte-Scolastique, and Mother Jacob.One of these refugees found herself almost at home.', 'She was a nun ofSainte-Aure, the only one of her order who had survived.', 'The ancientconvent of the ladies of Sainte-Aure occupied, at the beginning of theeighteenth century, this very house of the Petit-Picpus, which belongedlater to the Benedictines of Martin Verga.', 'This holy woman, too poor towear the magnificent habit of her order, which was a white robe with ascarlet scapulary, had piously put it on a little manikin, which sheexhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at herdeath.', 'In 1824, only one nun of this order remained; to-day, thereremains only a doll.In addition to these worthy mothers, some old society women hadobtained permission of the prioress, like Madame Albertine, to retireinto the Little Convent.', 'Among the number were Madame Beaufortd’Hautpoul and Marquise Dufresne.', 'Another was never known in theconvent except by the formidable noise which she made when she blew hernose.', 'The pupils called her Madame Vacarmini (hubbub).About 1820 or 1821, Madame de Genlis, who was at that time editing alittle periodical publication called _l’Intrépide_, asked to be allowedto enter the convent of the Petit-Picpus as lady resident.', 'The Ducd’Orléans recommended her.', 'Uproar in the hive; the vocal-mothers wereall in a flutter; Madame de Genlis had made romances.', 'But she declaredthat she was the first to detest them, and then, she had reached herfierce stage of devotion.', 'With the aid of God, and of the Prince, sheentered.', 'She departed at the end of six or eight months, alleging as areason, that there was no shade in the garden.', 'The nuns were delighted.Although very old, she still played the harp, and did it very well.When she went away she left her mark in her cell.', 'Madame de Genlis wassuperstitious and a Latinist.', 'These two words furnish a tolerably goodprofile of her.', 'A few years ago, there were still to be seen, pasted inthe inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up hersilverware and her jewels, these five lines in Latin, written with herown hand in red ink on yellow paper, and which, in her opinion,possessed the property of frightening away robbers:—Imparibus meritis pendent tria corpora ramis:Dismas et Gesmas, media est divina potestas;Alta petit Dismas, infelix, infima, Gesmas;Nos et res nostras conservet summa potestas.Hos versus dicas, ne tu furto tua perdas.15These verses in sixth century Latin raise the question whether the twothieves of Calvary were named, as is commonly believed, Dismas andGestas, or Dismas and Gesmas.', 'This orthography might have confoundedthe pretensions put forward in the last century by the Vicomte deGestas, of a descent from the wicked thief.', 'However, the useful virtueattached to these verses forms an article of faith in the order of theHospitallers.The church of the house, constructed in such a manner as to separatethe Great Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritableintrenchment, was, of course, common to the Boarding-school, the GreatConvent, and the Little Convent.', 'The public was even admitted by a sortof lazaretto entrance on the street.', 'But all was so arranged, that noneof the inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outsideworld.', 'Suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand, andfolded in such a manner as to form, not, as in ordinary churches, aprolongation behind the altar, but a sort of hall, or obscure cellar,to the right of the officiating priest; suppose this hall to be shutoff by a curtain seven feet in height, of which we have already spoken;in the shadow of that curtain, pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in thechoir on the left, the school-girls on the right, the lay-sisters andthe novices at the bottom, and you will have some idea of the nuns ofthe Petit-Picpus assisting at divine service.', 'That cavern, which wascalled the choir, communicated with the cloister by a lobby.', 'The churchwas lighted from the garden.', 'When the nuns were present at serviceswhere their rule enjoined silence, the public was warned of theirpresence only by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising andfalling.CHAPTER VII—SOME SILHOUETTES OF THIS DARKNESSDuring the six years which separate 1819 from 1825, the prioress of thePetit-Picpus was Mademoiselle de Blemeur, whose name, in religion, wasMother Innocente.', 'She came of the family of Marguerite de Blemeur,author of _Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint-Benoît_.', 'She hadbeen re-elected.', 'She was a woman about sixty years of age, short,thick, “singing like a cracked pot,” says the letter which we havealready quoted; an excellent woman, moreover, and the only merry one inthe whole convent, and for that reason adored.', 'She was learned,erudite, wise, competent, curiously proficient in history, crammed withLatin, stuffed with Greek, full of Hebrew, and more of a Benedictinemonk than a Benedictine nun.The sub-prioress was an old Spanish nun, Mother Cineres, who was almostblind.The most esteemed among the vocal mothers were Mother Sainte-Honorine;the treasurer, Mother Sainte-Gertrude, the chief mistress of thenovices; Mother-Saint-Ange, the assistant mistress; MotherAnnonciation, the sacristan; Mother Saint-Augustin, the nurse, the onlyone in the convent who was malicious; then Mother Sainte-Mechtilde(Mademoiselle Gauvain), very young and with a beautiful voice; Motherdes Anges (Mademoiselle Drouet), who had been in the convent of theFilles-Dieu, and in the convent du Trésor, between Gisors and Magny;Mother Saint-Joseph (Mademoiselle de Cogolludo), Mother Sainte-Adélaide(Mademoiselle d’Auverney), Mother Miséricorde (Mademoiselle deCifuentes, who could not resist austerities), Mother Compassion(Mademoiselle de la Miltière, received at the age of sixty in defianceof the rule, and very wealthy); Mother Providence (Mademoiselle deLaudinière), Mother Présentation (Mademoiselle de Siguenza), who wasprioress in 1847; and finally, Mother Sainte-Céligne (sister of thesculptor Ceracchi), who went mad; Mother Sainte-Chantal (Mademoisellede Suzon), who went mad.There was also, among the prettiest of them, a charming girl of threeand twenty, who was from the Isle de Bourbon, a descendant of theChevalier Roze, whose name had been Mademoiselle Roze, and who wascalled Mother Assumption.Mother Sainte-Mechtilde, intrusted with the singing and the choir, wasfond of making use of the pupils in this quarter.', 'She usually took acomplete scale of them, that is to say, seven, from ten to sixteenyears of age, inclusive, of assorted voices and sizes, whom she madesing standing, drawn up in a line, side by side, according to age, fromthe smallest to the largest.', 'This presented to the eye, something inthe nature of a reed-pipe of young girls, a sort of living Pan-pipemade of angels.Those of the lay-sisters whom the scholars loved most were SisterEuphrasie, Sister Sainte-Marguérite, Sister Sainte-Marthe, who was inher dotage, and Sister Sainte-Michel, whose long nose made them laugh.All these women were gentle with the children.', 'The nuns were severeonly towards themselves.', 'No fire was lighted except in the school, andthe food was choice compared to that in the convent.', 'Moreover, theylavished a thousand cares on their scholars.', 'Only, when a child passednear a nun and addressed her, the nun never replied.This rule of silence had had this effect, that throughout the wholeconvent, speech had been withdrawn from human creatures, and bestowedon inanimate objects.', 'Now it was the church-bell which spoke, now itwas the gardener’s bell.', 'A very sonorous bell, placed beside theportress, and which was audible throughout the house, indicated by itsvaried peals, which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph, all theactions of material life which were to be performed, and summoned tothe parlor, in case of need, such or such an inhabitant of the house.Each person and each thing had its own peal.', 'The prioress had one andone, the sub-prioress one and two.', 'Six-five announced lessons, so thatthe pupils never said “to go to lessons,” but “to go to six-five.”Four-four was Madame de Genlis’s signal.', 'It was very often heard.“C’est le diable a quatre,”—it’s the very deuce—said the uncharitable.Tennine strokes announced a great event.', 'It was the opening of _thedoor of seclusion_, a frightful sheet of iron bristling with boltswhich only turned on its hinges in the presence of the archbishop.With the exception of the archbishop and the gardener, no man enteredthe convent, as we have already said.', 'The schoolgirls saw two others:one, the chaplain, the Abbé Banés, old and ugly, whom they werepermitted to contemplate in the choir, through a grating; the other thedrawing-master, M. Ansiaux, whom the letter, of which we have perused afew lines, calls _M.', 'Anciot_, and describes as _a frightful oldhunchback_.It will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen.Such was this curious house.CHAPTER VIII—POST CORDA LAPIDESAfter having sketched its moral face, it will not prove unprofitable topoint out, in a few words, its material configuration.', 'The readeralready has some idea of it.The convent of the Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled almost the wholeof the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the RuePolonceau, the Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-Picpus, and the unusedlane, called Rue Aumarais on old plans.', 'These four streets surroundedthis trapezium like a moat.', 'The convent was composed of severalbuildings and a garden.', 'The principal building, taken in its entirety,was a juxtaposition of hybrid constructions which, viewed from abird’s-eye view, outlined, with considerable exactness, a gibbet laidflat on the ground.', 'The main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole ofthe fragment of the Rue Droit-Mur comprised between the RuePetit-Picpus and the Rue Polonceau; the lesser arm was a lofty, gray,severe grated façade which faced the Rue Petit-Picpus; the carriageentrance No.', '62 marked its extremity.', 'Towards the centre of this façadewas a low, arched door, whitened with dust and ashes, where the spiderswove their webs, and which was open only for an hour or two on Sundays,and on rare occasions, when the coffin of a nun left the convent.', 'Thiswas the public entrance of the church.', 'The elbow of the gibbet was asquare hall which was used as the servants’ hall, and which the nunscalled _the buttery_.', 'In the main arm were the cells of the mothers,the sisters, and the novices.', 'In the lesser arm lay the kitchens, therefectory, backed up by the cloisters and the church.', 'Between the doorNo.', '62 and the corner of the closed Aumarais Lane, was the school,which was not visible from without.', 'The remainder of the trapeziumformed the garden, which was much lower than the level of the RuePolonceau, which caused the walls to be very much higher on the insidethan on the outside.', 'The garden, which was slightly arched, had in itscentre, on the summit of a hillock, a fine pointed and conicalfir-tree, whence ran, as from the peaked boss of a shield, four grandalleys, and, ranged by twos in between the branchings of these, eightsmall ones, so that, if the enclosure had been circular, thegeometrical plan of the alleys would have resembled a cross superposedon a wheel.', 'As the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of thegarden, they were of unequal length.', 'They were bordered with currantbushes.', 'At the bottom, an alley of tall poplars ran from the ruins ofthe old convent, which was at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur to thehouse of the Little Convent, which was at the angle of the AumaraisLane.', 'In front of the Little Convent was what was called the littlegarden.', 'To this whole, let the reader add a courtyard, all sorts ofvaried angles formed by the interior buildings, prison walls, the longblack line of roofs which bordered the other side of the Rue Polonceaufor its sole perspective and neighborhood, and he will be able to formfor himself a complete image of what the house of the Bernardines ofthe Petit-Picpus was forty years ago.', 'This holy house had been built onthe precise site of a famous tennis-ground of the fourteenth to thesixteenth century, which was called the “tennis-ground of the eleventhousand devils.”All these streets, moreover, were more ancient than Paris.', 'These names,Droit-Mur and Aumarais, are very ancient; the streets which bear themare very much more ancient still.', 'Aumarais Lane was called MaugoutLane; the Rue Droit-Mur was called the Rue des Églantiers, for Godopened flowers before man cut stones.CHAPTER IX—A CENTURY UNDER A GUIMPESince we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of thePetit-Picpus was in former times, and since we have ventured to open awindow on that discreet retreat, the reader will permit us one otherlittle digression, utterly foreign to this book, but characteristic anduseful, since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures.In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbeyof Fontevrault.', 'She had even been in society before the Revolution.', 'Shetalked a great deal of M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals underLouis XVI.', 'and of a Presidentess Duplat, with whom she had been veryintimate.', 'It was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names onevery pretext.', 'She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,—that itwas like a city, and that there were streets in the monastery.She talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils.', 'Every year,she solemnly renewed her vows, and at the moment of taking the oath,she said to the priest, “Monseigneur Saint-François gave it toMonseigneur Saint-Julien, Monseigneur Saint-Julien gave it toMonseigneur Saint-Eusebius, Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius gave it toMonseigneur Saint-Procopius, etc., etc.', '; and thus I give it to you,father.” And the school-girls would begin to laugh, not in theirsleeves, but under their veils; charming little stifled laughs whichmade the vocal mothers frown.On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories.', 'She said that_in her youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as themousquetaires_.', 'It was a century which spoke through her, but it wasthe eighteenth century.', 'She told about the custom of the four wines,which existed before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne.', 'When agreat personage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer,traversed a town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out toharangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into whichthey had poured four different sorts of wine.', 'On the first goblet thisinscription could be read, _monkey wine_; on the second, _lion wine_;on the third, _sheep wine_; on the fourth, _hog wine_.', 'These fourlegends express the four stages descended by the drunkard; the first,intoxication, which enlivens; the second, that which irritates; thethird, that which dulls; and the fourth, that which brutalizes.In a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object ofwhich she thought a great deal.', 'The rule of Fontevrault did not forbidthis.', 'She would not show this object to anyone.', 'She shut herself up,which her rule allowed her to do, and hid herself, every time that shedesired to contemplate it.', 'If she heard a footstep in the corridor, sheclosed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her agedhands.', 'As soon as it was mentioned to her, she became silent, she whowas so fond of talking.', 'The most curious were baffled by her silenceand the most tenacious by her obstinacy.', 'Thus it furnished a subject ofcomment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent.', 'Whatcould that treasure of the centenarian be, which was so precious and sosecret?', 'Some holy book, no doubt?', 'Some unique chaplet?', 'Some authenticrelic?', 'They lost themselves in conjectures.', 'When the poor old womandied, they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting,perhaps, and opened it.', 'They found the object beneath a triple linencloth, like some consecrated paten.', 'It was a Faenza platterrepresenting little Loves flitting away pursued by apothecary ladsarmed with enormous syringes.', 'The chase abounds in grimaces and incomical postures.', 'One of the charming little Loves is already fairlyspitted.', 'He is resisting, fluttering his tiny wings, and still makingan effort to fly, but the dancer is laughing with a satanical air.Moral: Love conquered by the colic.', 'This platter, which is verycurious, and which had, possibly, the honor of furnishing Molière withan idea, was still in existence in September, 1845; it was for sale bya bric-à-brac merchant in the Boulevard Beaumarchais.This good old woman would not receive any visits from outside_because_, said she, the _parlor is too gloomy_.CHAPTER X—ORIGIN OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATIONHowever, this almost sepulchral parlor, of which we have sought toconvey an idea, is a purely local trait which is not reproduced withthe same severity in other convents.', 'At the convent of the Rue duTemple, in particular, which belonged, in truth, to another order, theblack shutters were replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itselfwas a salon with a polished wood floor, whose windows were draped inwhite muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames, aportrait of a Benedictine nun with unveiled face, painted bouquets, andeven the head of a Turk.It is in that garden of the Temple convent, that stood that famouschestnut-tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest inFrance, and which bore the reputation among the good people of theeighteenth century of being _the father of all the chestnut trees ofthe realm_.As we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied byBenedictines of the Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite differentfrom those who depended on Cîteaux.', 'This order of the PerpetualAdoration is not very ancient and does not go back more than twohundred years.', 'In 1649 the holy sacrament was profaned on two occasionsa few days apart, in two churches in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and atSaint-Jean en Grève, a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the wholetown in an uproar.', 'M. the Prior and Vicar-General of Saint-Germain desPrés ordered a solemn procession of all his clergy, in which the Pope’sNuncio officiated.', 'But this expiation did not satisfy two saintedwomen, Madame Courtin, Marquise de Boucs, and the Comtesse deChâteauvieux.', 'This outrage committed on “the most holy sacrament of thealtar,” though but temporary, would not depart from these holy souls,and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a “PerpetualAdoration” in some female monastery.', 'Both of them, one in 1652, theother in 1653, made donations of notable sums to Mother Catherine deBar, called of the Holy Sacrament, a Benedictine nun, for the purposeof founding, to this pious end, a monastery of the order ofSaint-Benoît; the first permission for this foundation was given toMother Catherine de Bar by M. de Metz, Abbé of Saint-Germain, “oncondition that no woman could be received unless she contributed threehundred livres income, which amounts to six thousand livres, to theprincipal.” After the Abbé of Saint-Germain, the king accordedletters-patent; and all the rest, abbatial charter, and royal letters,was confirmed in 1654 by the Chamber of Accounts and the Parliament.Such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment ofthe Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament atParis.', 'Their first convent was “a new building” in the Rue Cassette,out of the contributions of Mesdames de Boucs and de Châteauvieux.This order, as it will be seen, was not to be confounded with theBenedictine nuns of Cîteaux.', 'It mounted back to the Abbé ofSaint-Germain des Prés, in the same manner that the ladies of theSacred Heart go back to the general of the Jesuits, and the sisters ofcharity to the general of the Lazarists.It was also totally different from the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus,whose interior we have just shown.', 'In 1657, Pope Alexander VII.', 'hadauthorized, by a special brief, the Bernardines of the RuePetit-Picpus, to practise the Perpetual Adoration like the Benedictinenuns of the Holy Sacrament.', 'But the two orders remained distinctnonetheless.CHAPTER XI—END OF THE PETIT-PICPUSAt the beginning of the Restoration, the convent of the Petit-Picpuswas in its decay; this forms a part of the general death of the order,which, after the eighteenth century, has been disappearing like all thereligious orders.', 'Contemplation is, like prayer, one of humanity’sneeds; but, like everything which the Revolution touched, it will betransformed, and from being hostile to social progress, it will becomefavorable to it.The house of the Petit-Picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated.', 'In1840, the Little Convent had disappeared, the school had disappeared.There were no longer any old women, nor young girls; the first weredead, the latter had taken their departure.', '_Volaverunt_.The rule of the Perpetual Adoration is so rigid in its nature that italarms, vocations recoil before it, the order receives no recruits.', 'In1845, it still obtained lay-sisters here and there.', 'But of professednuns, none at all.', 'Forty years ago, the nuns numbered nearly a hundred;fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty-eight of them.', 'Howmany are there to-day?', 'In 1847, the prioress was young, a sign that thecircle of choice was restricted.', 'She was not forty years old.', 'Inproportion as the number diminishes, the fatigue increases, the serviceof each becomes more painful; the moment could then be seen drawingnear when there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bearthe heavy rule of Saint-Benoît.', 'The burden is implacable, and remainsthe same for the few as for the many.', 'It weighs down, it crushes.', 'Thusthey die.', 'At the period when the author of this book still lived inParis, two died.', 'One was twenty-five years old, the other twenty-three.This latter can say, like Julia Alpinula: _“Hic jaceo.', 'Vixi annosviginti et tres.” _ It is in consequence of this decay that the conventgave up the education of girls.We have not felt able to pass before this extraordinary house withoutentering it, and without introducing the minds which accompany us, andwhich are listening to our tale, to the profit of some, perchance, ofthe melancholy history of Jean Valjean.', 'We have penetrated into thiscommunity, full of those old practices which seem so novel to-day.', 'Itis the closed garden, _hortus conclusus_.', 'We have spoken of thissingular place in detail, but with respect, in so far, at least, asdetail and respect are compatible.', 'We do not understand all, but weinsult nothing.', 'We are equally far removed from the hosanna of Josephde Maistre, who wound up by anointing the executioner, and from thesneer of Voltaire, who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross.An illogical act on Voltaire’s part, we may remark, by the way; forVoltaire would have defended Jesus as he defended Calas; and even forthose who deny superhuman incarnations, what does the crucifixrepresent?', 'The assassinated sage.In this nineteenth century, the religious idea is undergoing a crisis.People are unlearning certain things, and they do well, provided that,while unlearning them they learn this: There is no vacuum in the humanheart.', 'Certain demolitions take place, and it is well that they do, buton condition that they are followed by reconstructions.In the meantime, let us study things which are no more.', 'It is necessaryto know them, if only for the purpose of avoiding them.', 'Thecounterfeits of the past assume false names, and gladly call themselvesthe future.', 'This spectre, this past, is given to falsifying its ownpassport.', 'Let us inform ourselves of the trap.', 'Let us be on our guard.The past has a visage, superstition, and a mask, hypocrisy.', 'Let usdenounce the visage and let us tear off the mask.As for convents, they present a complex problem,—a question ofcivilization, which condemns them; a question of liberty, whichprotects them.BOOK SEVENTH—PARENTHESISCHAPTER I—THE CONVENT AS AN ABSTRACT IDEAThis book is a drama, whose leading personage is the Infinite.Man is the second.Such being the case, and a convent having happened to be on our road,it has been our duty to enter it.', 'Why?', 'Because the convent, which iscommon to the Orient as well as to the Occident, to antiquity as wellas to modern times, to paganism, to Buddhism, to Mahometanism, as wellas to Christianity, is one of the optical apparatuses applied by man tothe Infinite.This is not the place for enlarging disproportionately on certainideas; nevertheless, while absolutely maintaining our reserves, ourrestrictions, and even our indignations, we must say that every time weencounter man in the Infinite, either well or ill understood, we feelourselves overpowered with respect.', 'There is, in the synagogue, in themosque, in the pagoda, in the wigwam, a hideous side which we execrate,and a sublime side, which we adore.', 'What a contemplation for the mind,and what endless food for thought, is the reverberation of God upon thehuman wall!CHAPTER II—THE CONVENT AS AN HISTORICAL FACTFrom the point of view of history, of reason, and of truth, monasticismis condemned.', 'Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are clogs inits circulation, cumbrous establishments, centres of idleness wherecentres of labor should exist.', 'Monastic communities are to the greatsocial community what the mistletoe is to the oak, what the wart is tothe human body.', 'Their prosperity and their fatness mean theimpoverishment of the country.', 'The monastic regime, good at thebeginning of civilization, useful in the reduction of the brutal by thespiritual, is bad when peoples have reached their manhood.', 'Moreover,when it becomes relaxed, and when it enters into its period ofdisorder, it becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered itsalutary in its period of purity, because it still continues to set theexample.Claustration has had its day.', 'Cloisters, useful in the early educationof modern civilization, have embarrassed its growth, and are injuriousto its development.', 'So far as institution and formation with relationto man are concerned, monasteries, which were good in the tenthcentury, questionable in the fifteenth, are detestable in thenineteenth.', 'The leprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeletontwo wonderful nations, Italy and Spain; the one the light, the otherthe splendor of Europe for centuries; and, at the present day, thesetwo illustrious peoples are but just beginning to convalesce, thanks tothe healthy and vigorous hygiene of 1789 alone.The convent—the ancient female convent in particular, such as it stillpresents itself on the threshold of this century, in Italy, in Austria,in Spain—is one of the most sombre concretions of the Middle Ages.', 'Thecloister, that cloister, is the point of intersection of horrors.', 'TheCatholic cloister, properly speaking, is wholly filled with the blackradiance of death.The Spanish convent is the most funereal of all.', 'There rise, inobscurity, beneath vaults filled with gloom, beneath domes vague withshadow, massive altars of Babel, as high as cathedrals; there immensewhite crucifixes hang from chains in the dark; there are extended, allnude on the ebony, great Christs of ivory; more than bleeding,—bloody;hideous and magnificent, with their elbows displaying the bones, theirknee-pans showing their integuments, their wounds showing their flesh,crowned with silver thorns, nailed with nails of gold, with blood dropsof rubies on their brows, and diamond tears in their eyes.', 'The diamondsand rubies seem wet, and make veiled beings in the shadow below weep,their sides bruised with the hair shirt and their iron-tipped scourges,their breasts crushed with wicker hurdles, their knees excoriated withprayer; women who think themselves wives, spectres who think themselvesseraphim.', 'Do these women think?', 'No.', 'Have they any will?', 'No.', 'Do theylove?', 'No.', 'Do they live?', 'No.', 'Their nerves have turned to bone; theirbones have turned to stone.', 'Their veil is of woven night.', 'Their breathunder their veil resembles the indescribably tragic respiration ofdeath.', 'The abbess, a spectre, sanctifies them and terrifies them.', 'Theimmaculate one is there, and very fierce.', 'Such are the ancientmonasteries of Spain.', 'Liars of terrible devotion, caverns of virgins,ferocious places.Catholic Spain is more Roman than Rome herself.', 'The Spanish conventwas, above all others, the Catholic convent.', 'There was a flavor of theOrient about it.', 'The archbishop, the kislar-aga of heaven, locked upand kept watch over this seraglio of souls reserved for God.', 'The nunwas the odalisque, the priest was the eunuch.', 'The fervent were chosenin dreams and possessed Christ.', 'At night, the beautiful, nude young mandescended from the cross and became the ecstasy of the cloistered one.Lofty walls guarded the mystic sultana, who had the crucified for hersultan, from all living distraction.', 'A glance on the outer world wasinfidelity.', 'The _in pace_ replaced the leather sack.', 'That which wascast into the sea in the East was thrown into the ground in the West.In both quarters, women wrung their hands;

it is with them only a question of definition,and in any case, if they do not believe in God, being great minds, theyprove God.We salute them as philosophers, while inexorably denouncing theirphilosophy.Let us go on.The remarkable thing about it is, also, their facility in payingthemselves off with words.', 'A metaphysical school of the North,impregnated to some extent with fog, has fancied that it has worked arevolution in human understanding by replacing the word Force with theword Will.To say: “the plant wills,” instead of: “the plant grows”: this would befecund in results, indeed, if we were to add: “the universe wills.”Why?', 'Because it would come to this: the plant wills, therefore it hasan _I_; the universe wills, therefore it has a God.As for us, who, however, in contradistinction to this school, rejectnothing _a priori_, a will in the plant, accepted by this school,appears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universedenied by it.To deny the will of the infinite, that is to say, God, is impossible onany other conditions than a denial of the infinite.', 'We havedemonstrated this.The negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism.', 'Everythingbecomes “a mental conception.”With nihilism, no discussion is possible; for the nihilist logic doubtsthe existence of its interlocutor, and is not quite sure that it existsitself.From its point of view, it is possible that it may be for itself, only“a mental conception.”Only, it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits inthe lump, simply by the utterance of the word, mind.In short, no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes allend in the monosyllable, No.To No there is only one reply, Yes.Nihilism has no point.There is no such thing as nothingness.', 'Zero does not exist.', 'Everythingis something.', 'Nothing is nothing.Man lives by affirmation even more than by bread.Even to see and to show does not suffice.', 'Philosophy should be anenergy; it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate thecondition of man.', 'Socrates should enter into Adam and produce MarcusAurelius; in other words, the man of wisdom should be made to emergefrom the man of felicity.', 'Eden should be changed into a Lyceum.', 'Scienceshould be a cordial.', 'To enjoy,—what a sad aim, and what a paltryambition!', 'The brute enjoys.', 'To offer thought to the thirst of men, togive them all as an elixir the notion of God, to make conscience andscience fraternize in them, to render them just by this mysteriousconfrontation;

to combat Caiphas the High-priest, Draco theLawgiver, Trimalcion the Legislator, Tiberius the Emperor; this isclear, direct, and limpid, and offers no obscurity.But the right to live apart, even with its inconveniences and itsabuses, insists on being stated and taken into account.', 'Cenobitism is ahuman problem.When one speaks of convents, those abodes of error, but of innocence,of aberration but of good-will, of ignorance but of devotion, oftorture but of martyrdom, it always becomes necessary to say either yesor no.A convent is a contradiction.', 'Its object, salvation; its means thereto,sacrifice.', 'The convent is supreme egoism having for its result supremeabnegation.To abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device ofmonasticism.In the cloister, one suffers in order to enjoy.', 'One draws a bill ofexchange on death.', 'One discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light.In the cloister, hell is accepted in advance as a post obit onparadise.The taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for witheternity.It does not seem to us, that on such a subject mockery is permissible.All about it is serious, the good as well as the bad.The just man frowns, but never smiles with a malicious sneer.', 'Weunderstand wrath, but not malice.CHAPTER VIII—FAITH, LAWA few words more.We blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues, we despisethe spiritual which is harsh toward the temporal;

it is the strange placewhence one beholds, as from the crest of a lofty mountain, on one sidethe abyss where we are, on the other, the abyss whither we shall go; itis the narrow and misty frontier separating two worlds, illuminated andobscured by both at the same time, where the ray of life which hasbecome enfeebled is mingled with the vague ray of death; it is the halfobscurity of the tomb.We, who do not believe what these women believe, but who, like them,live by faith,—we have never been able to think without a sort oftender and religious terror, without a sort of pity, that is full ofenvy, of those devoted, trembling and trusting creatures, of thesehumble and august souls, who dare to dwell on the very brink of themystery, waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which isnot yet open, turned towards the light which one cannot see, possessingthe sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is, aspiringtowards the gulf, and the unknown, their eyes fixed motionless on thedarkness, kneeling, bewildered, stupefied, shuddering, half lifted, attimes, by the deep breaths of eternity.BOOK EIGHTH—CEMETERIES TAKE THAT WHICH IS COMMITTED THEMCHAPTER I—WHICH TREATS OF THE MANNER OF ENTERING A CONVENTIt was into this house that Jean Valjean had, as Fauchelevent expressedit, “fallen from the sky.”He had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the RuePolonceau.', 'That hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle ofthe night, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall, of which he hadcaught a glimpse in the gloom, was the chapel.', 'That phantom which hehad seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was makingreparation; that bell, the sound of which had so strangely surprisedhim, was the gardener’s bell attached to the knee of FatherFauchelevent.Cosette once put to bed, Jean Valjean and Fauchelevent had, as we havealready seen, supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before agood, crackling fire; then, the only bed in the hut being occupied byCosette, each threw himself on a truss of straw.Before he shut his eyes, Jean Valjean said: “I must remain herehenceforth.” This remark trotted through Fauchelevent’s head all nightlong.To tell the truth, neither of them slept.Jean Valjean, feeling that he was discovered and that Javert was on hisscent, understood that he and Cosette were lost if they returned toParis.', 'Then the new storm which had just burst upon him had strandedhim in this cloister.', 'Jean Valjean had, henceforth, but one thought,—toremain there.', 'Now, for an unfortunate man in his position, this conventwas both the safest and the most dangerous of places; the mostdangerous, because, as no men might enter there, if he were discovered,it was a flagrant offence, and Jean Valjean would find but one stepintervening between the convent and prison; the safest, because, if hecould manage to get himself accepted there and remain there, who wouldever seek him in such a place?', 'To dwell in an impossible place wassafety.On his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains.', 'He began bydeclaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter.', 'How hadM.', 'Madeleine got there, when the walls were what they were?', 'Cloisterwalls are not to be stepped over.', 'How did he get there with a child?One cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in one’s arms.', 'Whowas that child?', 'Where did they both come from?', 'Since Fauchelevent hadlived in the convent, he had heard nothing of M. sur M., and he knewnothing of what had taken place there.', 'Father Madeleine had an airwhich discouraged questions; and besides, Fauchelevent said to himself:“One does not question a saint.” M. Madeleine had preserved all hisprestige in Fauchelevent’s eyes.', 'Only, from some words which JeanValjean had let fall, the gardener thought he could draw the inferencethat M. Madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times,and that he was pursued by his creditors; or that he had compromisedhimself in some political affair, and was in hiding; which last did notdisplease Fauchelevent, who, like many of our peasants of the North,had an old fund of Bonapartism about him.', 'While in hiding, M. Madeleinehad selected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simple that heshould wish to remain there.', 'But the inexplicable point, to whichFauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain,was that M. Madeleine should be there, and that he should have thatlittle girl with him.', 'Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke tothem, and still did not believe it possible.', 'The incomprehensible hadjust made its entrance into Fauchelevent’s hut.', 'Fauchelevent gropedabout amid conjectures, and could see nothing clearly but this: “M.Madeleine saved my life.” This certainty alone was sufficient anddecided his course.', 'He said to himself: “It is my turn now.” He addedin his conscience: “M.', 'Madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it wasa question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose ofdragging me out.” He made up his mind to save M. Madeleine.Nevertheless, he put many questions to himself and made himself diversreplies: “After what he did for me, would I save him if he were athief?', 'Just the same.', 'If he were an assassin, would I save him?', 'Justthe same.', 'Since he is a saint, shall I save him?', 'Just the same.”But what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent!Fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimericalundertaking; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder thanhis self-devotion, his good will, and a little of that old rusticcunning, on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generousenterprise, undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, andthe steep escarpments of the rule of Saint-Benoît.', 'Father Faucheleventwas an old man who had been an egoist all his life, and who, towardsthe end of his days, halt, infirm, with no interest left to him in theworld, found it sweet to be grateful, and perceiving a generous actionto be performed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the momentwhen he is dying, should find close to his hand a glass of good winewhich he had never tasted, and should swallow it with avidity.', 'We mayadd, that the air which he had breathed for many years in this conventhad destroyed all personality in him, and had ended by rendering a goodaction of some kind absolutely necessary to him.So he took his resolve: to devote himself to M. Madeleine.We have just called him a _poor peasant of Picardy_.', 'That descriptionis just, but incomplete.', 'At the point of this story which we have nowreached, a little of Father Fauchelevent’s physiology becomes useful.He was a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added trickery to hiscunning, and penetration to his ingenuousness.', 'Having, through variouscauses, failed in his business, he had descended to the calling of acarter and a laborer.', 'But, in spite of oaths and lashings, which horsesseem to require, something of the notary had lingered in him.', 'He hadsome natural wit; he talked good grammar; he conversed, which is a rarething in a village; and the other peasants said of him: “He talksalmost like a gentleman with a hat.” Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, tothat species, which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the lastcentury qualified as _demi-bourgeois, demi-lout_, and which themetaphors showered by the château upon the thatched cottage ticketed inthe pigeon-hole of the plebeian: _rather rustic, rather citified;pepper and salt_.', 'Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and harshly used byfate, worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless,an impulsive man, and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a preciousquality which prevents one from ever being wicked.', 'His defects and hisvices, for he had some, were all superficial; in short, his physiognomywas of the kind which succeeds with an observer.', 'His aged face had noneof those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, whichsignify malice or stupidity.At daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having done anenormous deal of thinking, and beheld M. Madeleine seated on his trussof straw, and watching Cosette’s slumbers.', 'Fauchelevent sat up andsaid:—“Now that you are here, how are you going to contrive to enter?”This remark summed up the situation and aroused Jean Valjean from hisreverie.The two men took counsel together.“In the first place,” said Fauchelevent, “you will begin by not settingfoot outside of this chamber, either you or the child.', 'One step in thegarden and we are done for.”“That is true.”“Monsieur Madeleine,” resumed Fauchelevent, “you have arrived at a veryauspicious moment, I mean to say a very inauspicious moment; one of theladies is very ill.', 'This will prevent them from looking much in ourdirection.', 'It seems that she is dying.', 'The prayers of the forty hoursare being said.', 'The whole community is in confusion.', 'That occupiesthem.', 'The one who is on the point of departure is a saint.', 'In fact, weare all saints here; all the difference between them and me is thatthey say ‘our cell,’ and that I say ‘my cabin.’ The prayers for thedying are to be said, and then the prayers for the dead.', 'We shall be atpeace here for to-day; but I will not answer for to-morrow.”“Still,” observed Jean Valjean, “this cottage is in the niche of thewall, it is hidden by a sort of ruin, there are trees, it is notvisible from the convent.”“And I add that the nuns never come near it.”“Well?” said Jean Valjean.The interrogation mark which accentuated this “well” signified: “itseems to me that one may remain concealed here?” It was to thisinterrogation point that Fauchelevent responded:—“There are the little girls.”“What little girls?” asked Jean Valjean.Just as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he haduttered, a bell emitted one stroke.“The nun is dead,” said he.', '“There is the knell.”And he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen.The bell struck a second time.“It is the knell, Monsieur Madeleine.', 'The bell will continue to strikeonce a minute for twenty-four hours, until the body is taken from thechurch.—You see, they play.', 'At recreation hours it suffices to have aball roll aside, to send them all hither, in spite of prohibitions, tohunt and rummage for it all about here.', 'Those cherubs are devils.”“Who?” asked Jean Valjean.“The little girls.', 'You would be very quickly discovered.', 'They wouldshriek: ‘Oh!', 'a man!’ There is no danger to-day.', 'There will be norecreation hour.', 'The day will be entirely devoted to prayers.', 'You hearthe bell.', 'As I told you, a stroke each minute.', 'It is the death knell.”“I understand, Father Fauchelevent.', 'There are pupils.”And Jean Valjean thought to himself:—“Here is Cosette’s education already provided.”Fauchelevent exclaimed:—“Pardine!', 'There are little girls indeed!', 'And they would bawl aroundyou!', 'And they would rush off!', 'To be a man here is to have the plague.You see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wildbeast.”Jean Valjean fell into more and more profound thought.—“This conventwould be our salvation,” he murmured.Then he raised his voice:—“Yes, the difficulty is to remain here.”“No,” said Fauchelevent, “the difficulty is to get out.”Jean Valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart.“To get out!”“Yes, Monsieur Madeleine.', 'In order to return here it is first necessaryto get out.”And after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded,Fauchelevent went on:—“You must not be found here in this fashion.', 'Whence come you?', 'For me,you fall from heaven, because I know you;

Madeleine in from the outside if M.Madeleine was not outside.', 'That that was the first problem.', 'And then,that there was another: the empty coffin.“What is that empty coffin?” asked Jean Valjean.Fauchelevent replied:—“The coffin of the administration.”“What coffin?', 'What administration?”“A nun dies.', 'The municipal doctor comes and says, ‘A nun has died.’ Thegovernment sends a coffin.', 'The next day it sends a hearse andundertaker’s men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery.', 'Theundertaker’s men will come and lift the coffin; there will be nothingin it.”“Put something in it.”“A corpse?', 'I have none.”“No.”“What then?”“A living person.”“What person?”“Me!” said Jean Valjean.Fauchelevent, who was seated, sprang up as though a bomb had burstunder his chair.“You!”“Why not?”Jean Valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up hisface like a flash from heaven in the winter.“You know, Fauchelevent, what you have said: ‘Mother Crucifixion isdead.’ and I add: ‘and Father Madeleine is buried.’”“Ah!', 'good, you can laugh, you are not speaking seriously.”“Very seriously, I must get out of this place.”“Certainly.”“l have told you to find a basket, and a cover for me also.”“Well?”“The basket will be of pine, and the cover a black cloth.”“In the first place, it will be a white cloth.', 'Nuns are buried inwhite.”“Let it be a white cloth, then.”“You are not like other men, Father Madeleine.”To behold such devices, which are nothing else than the savage anddaring inventions of the galleys, spring forth from the peaceablethings which surrounded him, and mingle with what he called the “pettycourse of life in the convent,” caused Fauchelevent as much amazementas a gull fishing in the gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis would inspire ina passer-by.Jean Valjean went on:—“The problem is to get out of here without being seen.', 'This offers themeans.', 'But give me some information, in the first place.', 'How is itmanaged?', 'Where is this coffin?”“The empty one?”“Yes.”“Downstairs, in what is called the dead-room.', 'It stands on twotrestles, under the pall.”“How long is the coffin?”“Six feet.”“What is this dead-room?”“It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window openingon the garden, which is closed on the outside by a shutter, and twodoors; one leads into the convent, the other into the church.”“What church?”“The church in the street, the church which any one can enter.”“Have you the keys to those two doors?”“No; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent;the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church.”“When does the porter open that door?”“Only to allow the undertaker’s men to enter, when they come to get thecoffin.', 'When the coffin has been taken out, the door is closed again.”“Who nails up the coffin?”“I do.”“Who spreads the pall over it?”“I do.”“Are you alone?”“Not another man, except the police doctor, can enter the dead-room.That is even written on the wall.”“Could you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep?”“No.', 'But I could hide you in a small, dark nook which opens on thedead-room, where I keep my tools to use for burials, and of which Ihave the key.”“At what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow?”“About three o’clock in the afternoon.', 'The burial will take place atthe Vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall.', 'It is not very near.”“I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all themorning.', 'And how about food?', 'I shall be hungry.”“I will bring you something.”“You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o’clock.”Fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger-joints.“But that is impossible!”“Bah!', 'Impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank?”What seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was, we repeat, a simplematter to Jean Valjean.', 'Jean Valjean had been in worse straits thanthis.', 'Any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contracthimself to fit the diameter of the escape.', 'The prisoner is subject toflight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him.An escape is a cure.', 'What does not a man undergo for the sake of acure?', 'To have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a baleof goods, to live for a long time in a box, to find air where there isnone, to economize his breath for hours, to know how to stifle withoutdying—this was one of Jean Valjean’s gloomy talents.Moreover, a coffin containing a living being,—that convict’sexpedient,—is also an imperial expedient.', 'If we are to credit the monkAustin Castillejo, this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth,desirous of seeing the Plombes for the last time after his abdication.He had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of Saint-Yustein this manner.Fauchelevent, who had recovered himself a little, exclaimed:—“But how will you manage to breathe?”“I will breathe.”“In that box!', 'The mere thought of it suffocates me.”“You surely must have a gimlet, you will make a few holes here andthere, around my mouth, and you will nail the top plank on loosely.”“Good!', 'And what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze?”“A man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze.”And Jean Valjean added:—“Father Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either becaught here, or accept this escape through the hearse.”Every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing andlounging between the two leaves of a half-shut door.', 'Who is there whohas not said to a cat, “Do come in!” There are men who, when anincident stands half-open before them, have the same tendency to haltin indecision between two resolutions, at the risk of getting crushedthrough the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate.', 'The over-prudent,cats as they are, and because they are cats, sometimes incur moredanger than the audacious.', 'Fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature.But Jean Valjean’s coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself.', 'Hegrumbled:—“Well, since there is no other means.”Jean Valjean resumed:—“The only thing which troubles me is what will take place at thecemetery.”“That is the very point that is not troublesome,” exclaimedFauchelevent.', '“If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, Iam sure of getting you out of the grave.', 'The grave-digger is adrunkard, and a friend of mine.', 'He is Father Mestienne.', 'An old fellowof the old school.', 'The grave-digger puts the corpses in the grave, andI put the grave-digger in my pocket.', 'I will tell you what will takeplace.', 'They will arrive a little before dusk, three-quarters of an hourbefore the gates of the cemetery are closed.', 'The hearse will drivedirectly up to the grave.', 'I shall follow;

at the second halt, hesaid to himself:—“Here is the grave.”Suddenly, he felt hands seize the coffin, then a harsh grating againstthe planks; he explained it to himself as the rope which was beingfastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity.Then he experienced a giddiness.The undertaker’s man and the grave-digger had probably allowed thecoffin to lose its balance, and had lowered the head before the foot.He recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal andmotionless.', 'He had just touched the bottom.He had a certain sensation of cold.A voice rose above him, glacial and solemn.', 'He heard Latin words, whichhe did not understand, pass over him, so slowly that he was able tocatch them one by one:—_“Qui dormiunt in terræ pulvere, evigilabunt; alii in vitam æternam, etalii in approbrium, ut videant semper.” _A child’s voice said:—_“De profundis.” _The grave voice began again:—_“Requiem æternam dona ei, Domine.” _The child’s voice responded:—_“Et lux perpetua luceat ei.” _He heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain onthe plank which covered him.', 'It was probably the holy water.He thought: “This will be over soon now.', 'Patience for a little whilelonger.', 'The priest will take his departure.', 'Fauchelevent will takeMestienne off to drink.', 'I shall be left.', 'Then Fauchelevent will returnalone, and I shall get out.', 'That will be the work of a good hour.”The grave voice resumed_“Requiescat in pace.” _And the child’s voice said:—_“Amen.” _Jean Valjean strained his ears, and heard something like retreatingfootsteps.“There, they are going now,” thought he.', '“I am alone.”All at once, he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be aclap of thunder.It was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin.A second shovelful fell.One of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up.A third shovelful of earth fell.Then a fourth.There are things which are too strong for the strongest man.', 'JeanValjean lost consciousness.CHAPTER VII—IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE ORIGIN OF THE SAYING: DON’T LOSETHE CARDThis is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay JeanValjean.When the hearse had driven off, when the priest and the choir boy hadentered the carriage again and taken their departure, Fauchelevent, whohad not taken his eyes from the grave-digger, saw the latter bend overand grasp his shovel, which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt.Then Fauchelevent took a supreme resolve.He placed himself between the grave and the grave-digger, crossed hisarms and said:—“I am the one to pay!”The grave-digger stared at him in amazement, and replied:—“What’s that, peasant?”Fauchelevent repeated:—“I am the one who pays!”“What?”“For the wine.”“What wine?”“That Argenteuil wine.”“Where is the Argenteuil?”“At the _Bon Coing_.”“Go to the devil!” said the grave-digger.And he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin.The coffin gave back a hollow sound.', 'Fauchelevent felt himself staggerand on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself.', 'He shoutedin a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began tomingle:—“Comrade!', 'Before the _Bon Coing_ is shut!”The grave-digger took some more earth on his shovel.', 'Faucheleventcontinued.“I will pay.”And he seized the man’s arm.“Listen to me, comrade.', 'I am the convent grave-digger, I have come tohelp you.', 'It is a business which can be performed at night.', 'Let usbegin, then, by going for a drink.”And as he spoke, and clung to this desperate insistence, thismelancholy reflection occurred to him: “And if he drinks, will he getdrunk?”“Provincial,” said the man, “if you positively insist upon it, Iconsent.', 'We will drink.', 'After work, never before.”And he flourished his shovel briskly.', 'Fauchelevent held him back.“It is Argenteuil wine, at six.”“Oh, come,” said the grave-digger, “you are a bell-ringer.', 'Ding dong,ding dong, that’s all you know how to say.', 'Go hang yourself.”And he threw in a second shovelful.Fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he wassaying.“Come along and drink,” he cried, “since it is I who pays the bill.”“When we have put the child to bed,” said the grave-digger.He flung in a third shovelful.Then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added:—“It’s cold to-night, you see, and the corpse would shriek out after usif we were to plant her there without a coverlet.”At that moment, as he loaded his shovel, the grave-digger bent over,and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped.', 'Fauchelevent’s wild gaze fellmechanically into that pocket, and there it stopped.The sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon; there was still lightenough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom ofthat yawning pocket.The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant cancontain, traversed Fauchelevent’s pupils.', 'An idea had just occurred tohim.He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind, without thegrave-digger, who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth,observing it, and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottomof it.The man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave.Just as he turned round to get the fifth, Fauchelevent looked calmly athim and said:—“By the way, you new man, have you your card?”The grave-digger paused.“What card?”“The sun is on the point of setting.”“That’s good, it is going to put on its nightcap.”“The gate of the cemetery will close immediately.”“Well, what then?”“Have you your card?”“Ah!', 'my card?” said the grave-digger.And he fumbled in his pocket.Having searched one pocket, he proceeded to search the other.', 'He passedon to his fobs, explored the first, returned to the second.“Why, no,” said he, “I have not my card.', 'I must have forgotten it.”“Fifteen francs fine,” said Fauchelevent.The grave-digger turned green.', 'Green is the pallor of livid people.“Ah!', 'Jésus-mon-Dieu-bancroche-à-bas-la-lune!”17 he exclaimed.', '“Fifteenfrancs fine!”“Three pieces of a hundred sous,” said Fauchelevent.The grave-digger dropped his shovel.Fauchelevent’s turn had come.“Ah, come now, conscript,” said Fauchelevent, “none of this despair.There is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave.Fifteen francs is fifteen francs, and besides, you may not be able topay it.', 'I am an old hand, you are a new one.', 'I know all the ropes andthe devices.', 'I will give you some friendly advice.', 'One thing is clear,the sun is on the point of setting, it is touching the dome now, thecemetery will be closed in five minutes more.”“That is true,” replied the man.“Five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave, it isas hollow as the devil, this grave, and to reach the gate in season topass it before it is shut.”“That is true.”“In that case, a fine of fifteen francs.”“Fifteen francs.”“But you have time.', 'Where do you live?”“A couple of steps from the barrier, a quarter of an hour from here.No.', '87 Rue de Vaugirard.”“You have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your bestspeed.”“That is exactly so.”“Once outside the gate, you gallop home, you get your card, you return,the cemetery porter admits you.', 'As you have your card, there will benothing to pay.', 'And you will bury your corpse.', 'I’ll watch it for you inthe meantime, so that it shall not run away.”“I am indebted to you for my life, peasant.”“Decamp!” said Fauchelevent.The grave-digger, overwhelmed with gratitude, shook his hand and setoff on a run.When the man had disappeared in the thicket, Fauchelevent listeneduntil he heard his footsteps die away in the distance, then he leanedover the grave, and said in a low tone:—“Father Madeleine!”There was no reply.Fauchelevent was seized with a shudder.', 'He tumbled rather than climbedinto the grave, flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried:—“Are you there?”Silence in the coffin.Fauchelevent, hardly able to draw his breath for trembling, seized hiscold chisel and his hammer, and pried up the coffin lid.Jean Valjean’s face appeared in the twilight; it was pale and his eyeswere closed.Fauchelevent’s hair rose upright on his head, he sprang to his feet,then fell back against the side of the grave, ready to swoon on thecoffin.', 'He stared at Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless.Fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh:—“He is dead!”And, drawing himself up, and folding his arms with such violence thathis clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders, he cried:—“And this is the way I save his life!”Then the poor man fell to sobbing.', 'He soliloquized the while, for it isan error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural.', 'Powerful emotionoften talks aloud.“It is Father Mestienne’s fault.', 'Why did that fool die?', 'What need wasthere for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one wasexpecting it?', 'It is he who has killed M.

do you carry off the mattock.”Night was falling.Jean Valjean experienced some difficulty in moving and in walking.', 'Hehad stiffened himself in that coffin, and had become a little like acorpse.', 'The rigidity of death had seized upon him between those fourplanks.', 'He had, in a manner, to thaw out, from the tomb.“You are benumbed,” said Fauchelevent.', '“It is a pity that I have a gameleg, for otherwise we might step out briskly.”“Bah!” replied Jean Valjean, “four paces will put life into my legsonce more.”They set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed.', 'Onarriving before the closed gate and the porter’s pavilion Fauchelevent,who held the grave-digger’s card in his hand, dropped it into the box,the porter pulled the rope, the gate opened, and they went out.“How well everything is going!” said Fauchelevent; “what a capital ideathat was of yours, Father Madeleine!”They passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world.In the neighborhood of the cemetery, a shovel and pick are equal to twopassports.The Rue Vaugirard was deserted.“Father Madeleine,” said Fauchelevent as they went along, and raisinghis eyes to the houses, “Your eyes are better than mine.', 'Show me No.87.”“Here it is,” said Jean Valjean.“There is no one in the street,” said Fauchelevent.', '“Give me yourmattock and wait a couple of minutes for me.”Fauchelevent entered No.', '87, ascended to the very top, guided by theinstinct which always leads the poor man to the garret, and knocked inthe dark, at the door of an attic.A voice replied: “Come in.”It was Gribier’s voice.Fauchelevent opened the door.', 'The grave-digger’s dwelling was, like allsuch wretched habitations, an unfurnished and encumbered garret.', 'Apacking-case—a coffin, perhaps—took the place of a commode, abutter-pot served for a drinking-fountain, a straw mattress served fora bed, the floor served instead of tables and chairs.', 'In a corner, on atattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet, a thin womanand a number of children were piled in a heap.', 'The whole of thispoverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned.', 'Onewould have said that there had been an earthquake “for one.” The coverswere displaced, the rags scattered about, the jug broken, the motherhad been crying, the children had probably been beaten; traces of avigorous and ill-tempered search.', 'It was plain that the grave-diggerhad made a desperate search for his card, and had made everybody in thegarret, from the jug to his wife, responsible for its loss.', 'He wore anair of desperation.But Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventureto take any notice of this sad side of his success.He entered and said:—“I have brought you back your shovel and pick.”Gribier gazed at him in stupefaction.“Is it you, peasant?”“And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of thecemetery.”And he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor.“What is the meaning of this?” demanded Gribier.“The meaning of it is, that you dropped your card out of your pocket,that I found it on the ground after you were gone, that I have buriedthe corpse, that I have filled the grave, that I have done your work,that the porter will return your card to you, and that you will nothave to pay fifteen francs.', 'There you have it, conscript.”“Thanks, villager!” exclaimed Gribier, radiant.', '“The next time I willpay for the drinks.”CHAPTER VIII—A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATORYAn hour later, in the darkness of night, two men and a child presentedthemselves at No.', '62 Rue Petit-Picpus.', 'The elder of the men lifted theknocker and rapped.They were Fauchelevent, Jean Valjean, and Cosette.The two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer’s in theRue du Chemin-Vert, where Fauchelevent had deposited her on thepreceding day.', 'Cosette had passed these twenty-four hours tremblingsilently and understanding nothing.', 'She trembled to such a degree thatshe wept.', 'She had neither eaten nor slept.', 'The worthy fruit-seller hadplied her with a hundred questions, without obtaining any other replythan a melancholy and unvarying gaze.', 'Cosette had betrayed nothing ofwhat she had seen and heard during the last two days.', 'She divined thatthey were passing through a crisis.', 'She was deeply conscious that itwas necessary to “be good.” Who has not experienced the sovereign powerof those two words, pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of aterrified little being: _Say nothing!', '_ Fear is mute.', 'Moreover, no oneguards a secret like a child.But when, at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours, shebeheld Jean Valjean again, she gave vent to such a cry of joy, that anythoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry, would have guessedthat it issued from an abyss.Fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass-words.', 'All thedoors opened.Thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out andhow to get in.The porter, who had received his instructions, opened the littleservant’s door which connected the courtyard with the garden, and whichcould still be seen from the street twenty years ago, in the wall atthe bottom of the court, which faced the carriage entrance.The porter admitted all three of them through this door, and from thatpoint they reached the inner, reserved parlor where Fauchelevent, onthe preceding day, had received his orders from the prioress.The prioress, rosary in hand, was waiting for them.', 'A vocal mother,with her veil lowered, stood beside her.A discreet candle lighted, one might almost say, made a show oflighting the parlor.The prioress passed Jean Valjean in review.', 'There is nothing whichexamines like a downcast eye.Then she questioned him:—“You are the brother?”“Yes, reverend Mother,” replied Fauchelevent.“What is your name?”Fauchelevent replied:—“Ultime Fauchelevent.”He really had had a brother named Ultime, who was dead.“Where do you come from?”Fauchelevent replied:—“From Picquigny, near Amiens.”“What is your age?”Fauchelevent replied:—“Fifty.”“What is your profession?”Fauchelevent replied:—“Gardener.”“Are you a good Christian?”Fauchelevent replied:—“Every one is in the family.”“Is this your little girl?”Fauchelevent replied:—“Yes, reverend Mother.”“You are her father?”Fauchelevent replied:—“Her grandfather.”The vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice“He answers well.”Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word.The prioress looked attentively at Cosette, and said half aloud to thevocal mother:—“She will grow up ugly.”The two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in thecorner of the parlor, then the prioress turned round and said:—“Father Fauvent, you will get another knee-cap with a bell.', 'Two will berequired now.”On the following day, therefore, two bells were audible in the garden,and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner oftheir veils.', 'At the extreme end of the garden, under the trees, twomen, Fauvent and another man, were visible as they dug side by side.', 'Anenormous event.', 'Their silence was broken to the extent of saying toeach other: “He is an assistant gardener.”The vocal mothers added: “He is a brother of Father Fauvent.”Jean Valjean was, in fact, regularly installed; he had his belledknee-cap; henceforth he was official.', 'His name was Ultime Fauchelevent.The most powerful determining cause of his admission had been theprioress’s observation upon Cosette: “She will grow up ugly.”The prioress, that pronounced prognosticator, immediately took a fancyto Cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil.There is nothing that is not strictly logical about this.It is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent, women areconscious of their faces; now, girls who are conscious of their beautydo not easily become nuns; the vocation being voluntary in inverseproportion to their good looks, more is to be hoped from the ugly thanfrom the pretty.', 'Hence a lively taste for plain girls.The whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, oldFauchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean,whom he had saved and sheltered; in those of grave-digger Gribier, whosaid to himself: “He spared me that fine”; with the convent, which,being enabled, thanks to him, to retain the coffin of MotherCrucifixion under the altar, eluded Cæsar and satisfied God.', 'There wasa coffin containing a body in the Petit-Picpus, and a coffin without abody in the Vaugirard cemetery, public order had no doubt been deeplydisturbed thereby, but no one was aware of it.As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great.Fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious ofgardeners.', 'Upon the occasion of the archbishop’s next visit, theprioress recounted the affair to his Grace, making something of aconfession at the same time, and yet boasting of her deed.', 'On leavingthe convent, the archbishop mentioned it with approval, and in awhisper to M. de Latil, Monsieur’s confessor, afterwards Archbishop ofReims and Cardinal.', 'This admiration for Fauchelevent became widespread,for it made its way to Rome.', 'We have seen a note addressed by the thenreigning Pope, Leo XII., to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in theNuncio’s establishment in Paris, and bearing, like himself, the name ofDella Genga; it contained these lines: “It appears that there is in aconvent in Paris an excellent gardener, who is also a holy man, namedFauvent.” Nothing of this triumph reached Fauchelevent in his hut; hewent on grafting, weeding, and covering up his melon beds, without inthe least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity.', 'Neither did hesuspect his glory, any more than a Durham or Surrey bull whose portraitis published in the _London Illustrated News_, with this inscription:“Bull which carried off the prize at the Cattle Show.”CHAPTER IX—CLOISTEREDCosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent.It was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean Valjean’sdaughter.', 'Moreover, as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, andthen, she would not have said anything in any case.', 'As we have justobserved, nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness.', 'Cosettehad suffered so much, that she feared everything, even to speak or tobreathe.', 'A single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her.She had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been withJean Valjean.', 'She speedily became accustomed to the convent.', 'Only sheregretted Catherine, but she dared not say so.', 'Once, however, she didsay to Jean Valjean: “Father, if I had known, I would have brought heraway with me.”Cosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, to donthe garb of the pupils of the house.', 'Jean Valjean succeeded in gettingthem to restore to him the garments which she laid aside.', 'This was thesame mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quittedthe Thénardiers’ inn.', 'It was not very threadbare even now.', 'Jean Valjeanlocked up these garments, plus the stockings and the shoes, with aquantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound, ina little valise which he found means of procuring.', 'He set this valiseon a chair near his bed, and he always carried the key about hisperson.', '“Father,” Cosette asked him one day, “what is there in that boxwhich smells so good?”Father Fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action, inaddition to the glory which we just mentioned, and of which he knewnothing; in the first place it made him happy; next, he had much lesswork, since it was shared.', 'Lastly, as he was very fond of snuff, hefound the presence of M. Madeleine an advantage, in that he used threetimes as much as he had done previously, and that in an infinitely moreluxurious manner, seeing that M. Madeleine paid for it.The nuns did not adopt the name of Ultime; they called Jean Valjean_the other Fauvent_.If these holy women had possessed anything of Javert’s glance, theywould eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be doneoutside in the behalf of the garden, it was always the elderFauchelevent, the old, the infirm, the lame man, who went, and neverthe other; but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on God know nothow to spy, or whether they were, by preference, occupied in keepingwatch on each other, they paid no heed to this.Moreover, it was well for Jean Valjean that he kept close and did notstir out.', 'Javert watched the quarter for more than a month.This convent was for Jean Valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs.Henceforth, those four walls constituted his world.', 'He saw enough ofthe sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity, and Cosetteenough to remain happy.A very sweet life began for him.He inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden, in company withFauchelevent.', 'This hovel, built of old rubbish, which was still inexistence in 1845, was composed, as the reader already knows, of threechambers, all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond thewalls.', 'The principal one had been given up, by force, for Jean Valjeanhad opposed it in vain, to M. Madeleine, by Father Fauchelevent.', 'Thewalls of this chamber had for ornament, in addition to the two nailswhereon to hang the knee-cap and the basket, a Royalist bank-note of’93, applied to the wall over the chimney-piece, and of which thefollowing is an exact facsimile:—Royalist Bank-note  2b8-9-banknoteThis specimen of Vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by thepreceding gardener, an old Chouan, who had died in the convent, andwhose place Fauchelevent had taken.Jean Valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself veryuseful.', 'He had formerly been a pruner of trees, and he gladly foundhimself a gardener once more.', 'It will be remembered that he knew allsorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture.', 'He turned these toadvantage.', 'Almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted, andwild.', 'He budded them and made them produce excellent fruit.Cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day.', 'As thesisters were melancholy and he was kind, the child made comparisons andadored him.', 'At the appointed hour she flew to the hut.', 'When she enteredthe lowly cabin, she filled it with paradise.', 'Jean Valjean blossomedout and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which heafforded Cosette.', 'The joy which we inspire has this charming property,that, far from growing meagre, like all reflections, it returns to usmore radiant than ever.', 'At recreation hours, Jean Valjean watched herrunning and playing in the distance, and he distinguished her laughfrom that of the rest.For Cosette laughed now.Cosette’s face had even undergone a change, to a certain extent.', 'Thegloom had disappeared from it.', 'A smile is the same as sunshine; itbanishes winter from the human countenance.Recreation over, when Cosette went into the house again, Jean Valjeangazed at the windows of her class-room, and at night he rose to look atthe windows of her dormitory.God has his own ways, moreover; the convent contributed, like Cosette,to uphold and complete the Bishop’s work in Jean Valjean.', 'It is certainthat virtue adjoins pride on one side.', 'A bridge built by the devilexists there.', 'Jean Valjean had been, unconsciously, perhaps, tolerablynear that side and that bridge, when Providence cast his lot in theconvent of the Petit-Picpus; so long as he had compared himself only tothe Bishop, he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remainedhumble; but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men ingeneral, and pride was beginning to spring up.', 'Who knows?', 'He might haveended by returning very gradually to hatred.The convent stopped him on that downward path.This was the second place of captivity which he had seen.', 'In his youth,in what had been for him the beginning of his life, and later on, quiterecently again, he had beheld another,—a frightful place, a terribleplace, whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity ofjustice, and the crime of the law.', 'Now, after the galleys, he saw thecloister; and when he meditated how he had formed a part of thegalleys, and that he now, so to speak, was a spectator of the cloister,he confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety.Sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe, and slowlydescended the endless spirals of reverie.He recalled his former companions: how wretched they were; they rose atdawn, and toiled until night; hardly were they permitted to sleep; theylay on camp beds, where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inchesthick, in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months ofthe year; they were clothed in frightful red blouses; they wereallowed, as a great favor, linen trousers in the hottest weather, and awoollen carter’s blouse on their backs when it was very cold; theydrank no wine, and ate no meat, except when they went on “fatigueduty.” They lived nameless, designated only by numbers, and converted,after a manner, into ciphers themselves, with downcast eyes, withlowered voices, with shorn heads, beneath the cudgel and in disgrace.Then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes.These beings also lived with shorn heads, with downcast eyes, withlowered voices, not in disgrace, but amid the scoffs of the world, notwith their backs bruised with the cudgel, but with their shoulderslacerated with their discipline.', 'Their names, also, had vanished fromamong men; they no longer existed except under austere appellations.They never ate meat and they never drank wine; they often remaineduntil evening without food; they were attired, not in a red blouse, butin a black shroud, of woollen, which was heavy in summer and thin inwinter, without the power to add or subtract anything from it; withouthaving even, according to the season, the resource of the linen garmentor the woollen cloak; and for six months in the year they wore sergechemises which gave them fever.', 'They dwelt, not in rooms warmed onlyduring rigorous cold, but in cells where no fire was ever lighted; theyslept, not on mattresses two inches thick, but on straw.', 'And finally,they were not even allowed their sleep; every night, after a day oftoil, they were obliged, in the weariness of their first slumber, atthe moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to getwarm, to rouse themselves, to rise and to go and pray in an ice-coldand gloomy chapel, with their knees on the stones.On certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelvesuccessive hours in a kneeling posture, or prostrate, with face uponthe pavement, and arms outstretched in the form of a cross.The others were men; these were women.What had those men done?', 'They had stolen, violated, pillaged, murdered,assassinated.', 'They were bandits, counterfeiters, poisoners,incendiaries, murderers, parricides.', 'What had these women done?', 'Theyhad done nothing whatever.On the one hand, highway robbery, fraud, deceit, violence, sensuality,homicide, all sorts of sacrilege, every variety of crime; on the other,one thing only, innocence.Perfect innocence, almost caught up into heaven in a mysteriousassumption, attached to the earth by virtue, already possessingsomething of heaven through holiness.On the one hand, confidences over crimes, which are exchanged inwhispers; on the other, the confession of faults made aloud.', 'And whatcrimes!', 'And what faults!On the one hand, miasms; on the other, an ineffable perfume.', 'On the onehand, a moral pest, guarded from sight, penned up under the range ofcannon, and literally devouring its plague-stricken victims; on theother, the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth.', 'There,darkness; here, the shadow; but a shadow filled with gleams of light,and of gleams full of radiance.Two strongholds of slavery; but in the first, deliverance possible, alegal limit always in sight, and then, escape.', 'In the second,perpetuity; the sole hope, at the distant extremity of the future, thatfaint light of liberty which men call death.In the first, men are bound only with chains; in the other, chained byfaith.What flowed from the first?', 'An immense curse, the gnashing of teeth,hatred, desperate viciousness, a cry of rage against human society, asarcasm against heaven.What results flowed from the second?', 'Blessings and love.And in these two places, so similar yet so unlike, these two species ofbeings who were so very unlike, were undergoing the same work,expiation.Jean Valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former; thatpersonal expiation, the expiation for one’s self.', 'But he did notunderstand that of these last, that of creatures without reproach andwithout stain, and he trembled as he asked himself: The expiation ofwhat?', 'What expiation?A voice within his conscience replied: “The most divine of humangenerosities, the expiation for others.”Here all personal theory is withheld; we are only the narrator; weplace ourselves at Jean Valjean’s point of view, and we translate hisimpressions.Before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation, the highestpossible pitch of virtue; the innocence which pardons men their faults,and which expiates in their stead; servitude submitted to, tortureaccepted, punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned, for thesake of sparing it to souls which have fallen; the love of humanityswallowed up in the love of God, but even there preserving its distinctand mediatorial character; sweet and feeble beings possessing themisery of those who are punished and the smile of those who arerecompensed.And he remembered that he had dared to murmur!Often, in the middle of the night, he rose to listen to the gratefulsong of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities, and theblood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justlychastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy, and thathe, wretch that he was, had shaken his fist at God.There was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply, likea warning whisper from Providence itself: the scaling of that wall, thepassing of those barriers, the adventure accepted even at the risk ofdeath, the painful and difficult ascent, all those efforts even, whichhe had made to escape from that other place of expiation, he had madein order to gain entrance into this one.', 'Was this a symbol of hisdestiny?', 'This house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholyresemblance to that other one whence he had fled, and yet he had neverconceived an idea of anything similar.Again he beheld gratings, bolts, iron bars—to guard whom?', 'Angels.These lofty walls which he had seen around tigers, he now beheld oncemore around lambs.This was a place of expiation, and not of punishment; and yet, it wasstill more austere, more gloomy, and more pitiless than the other.These virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts.', 'Acold, harsh wind, that wind which had chilled his youth, traversed thebarred and padlocked grating of the vultures; a still harsher and morebiting breeze blew in the cage of these doves.Why?When he thought on these things, all that was within him was lost inamazement before this mystery of sublimity.In these meditations, his pride vanished.', 'He scrutinized his own heartin all manner of ways; he felt his pettiness, and many a time he wept.All that had entered into his life for the last six months had led himback towards the Bishop’s holy injunctions; Cosette through love, theconvent through humility.Sometimes at eventide, in the twilight, at an hour when the garden wasdeserted, he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk whichskirted the chapel, in front of the window through which he had gazedon the night of his arrival, and turned towards the spot where, as heknew, the sister was making reparation, prostrated in prayer.', 'Thus heprayed as he knelt before the sister.It seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before God.Everything that surrounded him, that peaceful garden, those fragrantflowers, those children who uttered joyous cries, those grave andsimple women, that silent cloister, slowly permeated him, and little bylittle, his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister, ofperfume like the flowers, of simplicity like the women, of joy like thechildren.', 'And then he reflected that these had been two houses of Godwhich had received him in succession at two critical moments in hislife: the first, when all doors were closed and when human societyrejected him; the second, at a moment when human society had again setout in pursuit of him, and when the galleys were again yawning; andthat, had it not been for the first, he should have relapsed intocrime, and had it not been for the second, into torment.His whole heart melted in gratitude, and he loved more and more.Many years passed in this manner;

he is like the flies ofheaven, who have none of these things.', 'He is from seven to thirteenyears of age, he lives in bands, roams the streets, lodges in the openair, wears an old pair of trousers of his father’s, which descend belowhis heels, an old hat of some other father, which descends below hisears, a single suspender of yellow listing; he runs, lies in wait,rummages about, wastes time, blackens pipes, swears like a convict,haunts the wine-shop, knows thieves, calls gay women _thou_, talksslang, sings obscene songs, and has no evil in his heart.', 'This isbecause he has in his heart a pearl, innocence; and pearls are not tobe dissolved in mud.', 'So long as man is in his childhood, God wills thathe shall be innocent.If one were to ask that enormous city: “What is this?” she would reply:“It is my little one.”CHAPTER II—SOME OF HIS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICSThe gamin—the street Arab—of Paris is the dwarf of the giant.Let us not exaggerate, this cherub of the gutter sometimes has a shirt,but, in that case, he owns but one; he sometimes has shoes, but thenthey have no soles; he sometimes has a lodging, and he loves it, for hefinds his mother there; but he prefers the street, because there hefinds liberty.', 'He has his own games, his own bits of mischief, whosefoundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois; his peculiarmetaphors: to be dead is _to eat dandelions by the root_; his ownoccupations, calling hackney-coaches, letting down carriage-steps,establishing means of transit between the two sides of a street inheavy rains, which he calls _making the bridge of arts_, cryingdiscourses pronounced by the authorities in favor of the French people,cleaning out the cracks in the pavement; he has his own coinage, whichis composed of all the little morsels of worked copper which are foundon the public streets.', 'This curious money, which receives the name of_loques_—rags—has an invariable and well-regulated currency in thislittle Bohemia of children.Lastly, he has his own fauna, which he observes attentively in thecorners; the lady-bird, the death’s-head plant-louse, thedaddy-long-legs, “the devil,” a black insect, which menaces by twistingabout its tail armed with two horns.', 'He has his fabulous monster, whichhas scales under its belly, but is not a lizard, which has pustules onits back, but is not a toad, which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilnsand wells that have run dry, which is black, hairy, sticky, whichcrawls sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly, which has no cry, but whichhas a look, and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it; he callsthis monster “the deaf thing.” The search for these “deaf things” amongthe stones is a joy of formidable nature.', 'Another pleasure consists insuddenly prying up a paving-stone, and taking a look at the wood-lice.Each region of Paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures whichare to be found there.', 'There are ear-wigs in the timber-yards of theUrsulines, there are millepeds in the Pantheon, there are tadpoles inthe ditches of the Champs-de-Mars.As far as sayings are concerned, this child has as many of them asTalleyrand.', 'He is no less cynical, but he is more honest.', 'He is endowedwith a certain indescribable, unexpected joviality; he upsets thecomposure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter.', 'He ranges boldlyfrom high comedy to farce.A funeral passes by.', 'Among those who accompany the dead there is adoctor.', '“Hey there!” shouts some street Arab, “how long has it beencustomary for doctors to carry home their own work?”Another is in a crowd.', 'A grave man, adorned with spectacles andtrinkets, turns round indignantly: “You good-for-nothing, you haveseized my wife’s waist!”—“I, sir?', 'Search me!”CHAPTER III—HE IS AGREEABLEIn the evening, thanks to a few sous, which he always finds means toprocure, the _homuncio_ enters a theatre.', 'On crossing that magicthreshold, he becomes transfigured; he was the street Arab, he becomesthe titi.18 Theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with thekeel in the air.', 'It is in that keel that the titi huddle together.', 'Thetiti is to the gamin what the moth is to the larva; the same beingendowed with wings and soaring.', 'It suffices for him to be there, withhis radiance of happiness, with his power of enthusiasm and joy, withhis hand-clapping, which resembles a clapping of wings, to confer onthat narrow, dark, fetid, sordid, unhealthy, hideous, abominable keel,the name of Paradise.Bestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary,and you have the gamin.The gamin is not devoid of literary intuition.', 'His tendency, and we sayit with the proper amount of regret, would not constitute classictaste.', 'He is not very academic by nature.', 'Thus, to give an example, thepopularity of Mademoiselle Mars among that little audience of stormychildren was seasoned with a touch of irony.', 'The gamin called her_Mademoiselle Muche_—“hide yourself.”This being bawls and scoffs and ridicules and fights, has rags like ababy and tatters like a philosopher, fishes in the sewer, hunts in thecesspool, extracts mirth from foulness, whips up the squares with hiswit, grins and bites, whistles and sings, shouts, and shrieks, tempersAlleluia with Matanturlurette, chants every rhythm from the DeProfundis to the Jack-pudding, finds without seeking, knows what he isignorant of, is a Spartan to the point of thieving, is mad to wisdom,is lyrical to filth, would crouch down on Olympus, wallows in thedunghill and emerges from it covered with stars.', 'The gamin of Paris isRabelais in this youth.He is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch-pocket.He is not easily astonished, he is still less easily terrified, hemakes songs on superstitions, he takes the wind out of exaggerations,he twits mysteries, he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts, he takes thepoetry out of stilted things, he introduces caricature into epicextravaganzas.', 'It is not that he is prosaic; far from that; but hereplaces the solemn vision by the farcical phantasmagoria.', 'If Adamastorwere to appear to him, the street Arab would say: “Hi there!', 'Thebugaboo!”CHAPTER IV—HE MAY BE OF USEParis begins with the lounger and ends with the street Arab, two beingsof which no other city is capable; the passive acceptance, whichcontents itself with gazing, and the inexhaustible initiative;Prudhomme and Fouillou.', 'Paris alone has this in its natural history.The whole of the monarchy is contained in the lounger; the whole ofanarchy in the gamin.This pale child of the Parisian faubourgs lives and develops, makesconnections, “grows supple” in suffering, in the presence of socialrealities and of human things, a thoughtful witness.', 'He thinks himselfheedless; and he is not.', 'He looks and is on the verge of laughter; heis on the verge of something else also.', 'Whoever you may be, if yourname is Prejudice, Abuse, Ignorance, Oppression, Iniquity, Despotism,Injustice, Fanaticism, Tyranny, beware of the gaping gamin.The little fellow will grow up.Of what clay is he made?', 'Of the first mud that comes to hand.', 'A handfulof dirt, a breath, and behold Adam.', 'It suffices for a God to pass by.', 'AGod has always passed over the street Arab.', 'Fortune labors at this tinybeing.', 'By the word “fortune” we mean chance, to some extent.', 'That pigmykneaded out of common earth, ignorant, unlettered, giddy, vulgar, low.Will that become an Ionian or a Bœotian?', 'Wait, _currit rota_, theSpirit of Paris, that demon which creates the children of chance andthe men of destiny, reversing the process of the Latin potter, makes ofa jug an amphora.CHAPTER V—HIS FRONTIERSThe gamin loves the city, he also loves solitude, since he hassomething of the sage in him.', '_Urbis amator_, like Fuscus; _rurisamator_, like Flaccus.To roam thoughtfully about, that is to say, to lounge, is a fineemployment of time in the eyes of the philosopher; particularly in thatrather illegitimate species of campaign, which is tolerably ugly butodd and composed of two natures, which surrounds certain great cities,notably Paris.', 'To study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal.End of the trees, beginning of the roofs; end of the grass, beginningof the pavements; end of the furrows, beginning of the shops, end ofthe wheel-ruts, beginning of the passions; end of the divine murmur,beginning of the human uproar; hence an extraordinary interest.Hence, in these not very attractive places, indelibly stamped by thepassing stroller with the epithet: _melancholy_, the apparentlyobjectless promenades of the dreamer.He who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers ofParis, and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs.', 'Thatclose-shaven turf, those pebbly paths, that chalk, those pools, thoseharsh monotonies of waste and fallow lands, the plants of earlymarket-garden suddenly springing into sight in a bottom, that mixtureof the savage and the citizen, those vast desert nooks where thegarrison drums practise noisily, and produce a sort of lisping ofbattle, those hermits by day and cut-throats by night, that clumsy millwhich turns in the wind, the hoisting-wheels of the quarries, thetea-gardens at the corners of the cemeteries; the mysterious charm ofgreat, sombre walls squarely intersecting immense, vague stretches ofland inundated with sunshine and full of butterflies,—all thisattracted him.There is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with thosesingular spots, the Glacière, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Grenelleall speckled with balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, Aubiers onthe bank of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the Pierre-Platede Châtillon, where there is an old, exhausted quarry which no longerserves any purpose except to raise mushrooms, and which is closed, on alevel with the ground, by a trap-door of rotten planks.', 'The campagna ofRome is one idea, the banlieue of Paris is another; to behold nothingbut fields, houses, or trees in what a stretch of country offers us, isto remain on the surface; all aspects of things are thoughts of God.The spot where a plain effects its junction with a city is alwaysstamped with a certain piercing melancholy.', 'Nature and humanity bothappeal to you at the same time there.', 'Local originalities there maketheir appearance.Any one who, like ourselves, has wandered about in these solitudescontiguous to our faubourgs, which may be designated as the limbos ofParis, has seen here and there, in the most desert spot, at the mostunexpected moment, behind a meagre hedge, or in the corner of alugubrious wall, children grouped tumultuously, fetid, muddy, dusty,ragged, dishevelled, playing hide-and-seek, and crowned withcorn-flowers.', 'All of them are little ones who have made their escapefrom poor families.', 'The outer boulevard is their breathing space; thesuburbs belong to them.', 'There they are eternally playing truant.', 'Therethey innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs.', 'There they are, orrather, there they exist, far from every eye, in the sweet light of Mayor June, kneeling round a hole in the ground, snapping marbles withtheir thumbs, quarrelling over half-farthings, irresponsible, volatile,free and happy; and, no sooner do they catch sight of you than theyrecollect that they have an industry, and that they must earn theirliving, and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled withcockchafers, or a bunch of lilacs.', 'These encounters with strangechildren are one of the charming and at the same time poignant gracesof the environs of Paris.Sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys,—are theytheir sisters?—who are almost young maidens, thin, feverish, withsunburnt hands, covered with freckles, crowned with poppies and ears ofrye, gay, haggard, barefooted.', 'They can be seen devouring cherriesamong the wheat.', 'In the evening they can be heard laughing.', 'Thesegroups, warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday, or indistinctlyseen in the twilight, occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time,and these visions mingle with his dreams.Paris, centre, banlieue, circumference; this constitutes all the earthto those children.', 'They never venture beyond this.', 'They can no moreescape from the Parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from thewater.', 'For them, nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers: Ivry,Gentilly, Arcueil, Belleville, Aubervilliers, Ménilmontant,Choisy-le-Roi, Billancourt, Meudon, Issy, Vanvre, Sèvres, Puteaux,Neuilly, Gennevilliers, Colombes, Romainville, Chatou, Asnières,Bougival, Nanterre, Enghien, Noisy-le-Sec, Nogent, Gournay, Drancy,Gonesse; the universe ends there.CHAPTER VI—A BIT OF HISTORYAt the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action of thisbook takes place, there was not, as there is to-day, a policeman at thecorner of every street (a benefit which there is no time to discusshere); stray children abounded in Paris.', 'The statistics give an averageof two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at thatperiod, by the police patrols, in unenclosed lands, in houses inprocess of construction, and under the arches of the bridges.', 'One ofthese nests, which has become famous, produced “the swallows of thebridge of Arcola.” This is, moreover, the most disastrous of socialsymptoms.', 'All crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child.Let us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless.', 'In a relativemeasure, and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled, theexception is just.', 'While in any other great city the vagabond child isa lost man, while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is, insome sort, sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in thepublic vices which devour in him honesty and conscience, the street boyof Paris, we insist on this point, however defaced and injured on thesurface, is almost intact on the interior.', 'It is a magnificent thing toput on record, and one which shines forth in the splendid probity ofour popular revolutions, that a certain incorruptibility results fromthe idea which exists in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the waterof the ocean.', 'To breathe Paris preserves the soul.What we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart whichone experiences every time that one meets one of these children aroundwhom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a brokenfamily.', 'In the civilization of the present day, incomplete as it stillis, it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured familiespouring themselves out into the darkness, not knowing clearly what hasbecome of their children, and allowing their own entrails to fall onthe public highway.', 'Hence these obscure destinies.', 'This is called, forthis sad thing has given rise to an expression, “to be cast on thepavements of Paris.”Let it be said by the way, that this abandonment of children was notdiscouraged by the ancient monarchy.', 'A little of Egypt and Bohemia inthe lower regions suited the upper spheres, and compassed the aims ofthe powerful.', 'The hatred of instruction for the children of the peoplewas a dogma.', 'What is the use of “half-lights”?', 'Such was thecountersign.', 'Now, the erring child is the corollary of the ignorantchild.Besides this, the monarchy sometimes was in need of children, and inthat case it skimmed the streets.Under Louis XIV., not to go any further back, the king rightly desiredto create a fleet.', 'The idea was a good one.', 'But let us consider themeans.', 'There can be no fleet, if, beside the sailing ship, thatplaything of the winds, and for the purpose of towing it, in case ofnecessity, there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases, eitherby means of oars or of steam; the galleys were then to the marine whatsteamers are to-day.', 'Therefore, galleys were necessary; but the galleyis moved only by the galley-slave; hence, galley-slaves were required.Colbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliaments make asmany convicts as possible.', 'The magistracy showed a great deal ofcomplaisance in the matter.', 'A man kept his hat on in the presence of aprocession—it was a Huguenot attitude; he was sent to the galleys.', 'Achild was encountered in the streets; provided that he was fifteenyears of age and did not know where he was to sleep, he was sent to thegalleys.', 'Grand reign; grand century.Under Louis XV.', 'children disappeared in Paris; the police carried themoff, for what mysterious purpose no one knew.', 'People whispered withterror monstrous conjectures as to the king’s baths of purple.', 'Barbierspeaks ingenuously of these things.', 'It sometimes happened that theexempts of the guard, when they ran short of children, took those whohad fathers.', 'The fathers, in despair, attacked the exempts.', 'In thatcase, the parliament intervened and had some one hung.', 'Who?', 'Theexempts?', 'No, the fathers.CHAPTER VII—THE GAMIN SHOULD HAVE HIS PLACE IN THE CLASSIFICATIONS OFINDIAThe body of street Arabs in Paris almost constitutes a caste.', 'One mightalmost say: Not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so.This word _gamin_ was printed for the first time, and reached popularspeech through the literary tongue, in 1834.', 'It is in a little workentitled _Claude Gueux_ that this word made its appearance.', 'The horrorwas lively.', 'The word passed into circulation.The elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for eachother are very various.', 'We have known and associated with one who wasgreatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fallfrom the top of the tower of Notre-Dame; another, because he hadsucceeded in making his way into the rear courtyard where the statuesof the dome of the Invalides had been temporarily deposited, and had“prigged” some lead from them; a third, because he had seen a diligencetip over; still another, because he “knew” a soldier who came nearputting out the eye of a citizen.This explains that famous exclamation of a Parisian gamin, a profoundepiphonema, which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending,—_Dieu de Dieu!', 'What ill-luck I do have!', 'to think that I have never yetseen anybody tumble from a fifth-story window!', '_ (_I have_ pronounced_I’ave_ and _fifth_ pronounced _fift’_.', ')Surely, this saying of a peasant is a fine one: “Father So-and-So, yourwife has died of her malady; why did you not send for the doctor?”“What would you have, sir, we poor folks _die of ourselves_.” But ifthe peasant’s whole passivity lies in this saying, the whole of thefree-thinking anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is, assuredly,contained in this other saying.', 'A man condemned to death is listeningto his confessor in the tumbrel.', 'The child of Paris exclaims: “He istalking to his black cap!', 'Oh, the sneak!”A certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin.', 'To bestrong-minded is an important item.To be present at executions constitutes a duty.', 'He shows himself at theguillotine, and he laughs.', 'He calls it by all sorts of pet names: TheEnd of the Soup, The Growler, The Mother in the Blue (the sky), TheLast Mouthful, etc., etc.', 'In order not to lose anything of the affair,he scales the walls, he hoists himself to balconies, he ascends trees,he suspends himself to gratings, he clings fast to chimneys.', 'The gaminis born a tiler as he is born a mariner.', 'A roof inspires him with nomore fear than a mast.', 'There is no festival which comes up to anexecution on the Place de Grève.', 'Samson and the Abbé Montès are thetruly popular names.', 'They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him.They sometimes admire him.', 'Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing thehideous Dautin die bravely, uttered these words which contain a future:“I was jealous of him.” In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is notknown, but Papavoine is.', '“Politicians” are confused with assassins inthe same legend.', 'They have a tradition as to everybody’s last garment.It is known that Tolleron had a fireman’s cap, Avril an otter cap,Losvel a round hat, that old Delaporte was bald and bareheaded, thatCastaing was all ruddy and very handsome, that Bories had a romanticsmall beard, that Jean Martin kept on his suspenders, that Lecouffé andhis mother quarrelled.', '“Don’t reproach each other for your basket,”shouted a gamin to them.', 'Another, in order to get a look at Debacker ashe passed, and being too small in the crowd, caught sight of thelantern on the quay and climbed it.', 'A gendarme stationed oppositefrowned.', '“Let me climb up, m’sieu le gendarme,” said the gamin.', 'And, tosoften the heart of the authorities he added: “I will not fall.” “Idon’t care if you do,” retorted the gendarme.In the brotherhood of gamins, a memorable accident counts for a greatdeal.', 'One reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cutone’s self very deeply, “to the very bone.”The fist is no mediocre element of respect.', 'One of the things that thegamin is fondest of saying is: “I am fine and strong, come now!” To beleft-handed renders you very enviable.', 'A squint is highly esteemed.CHAPTER VIII—IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A CHARMING SAYING OF THELAST KINGIn summer, he metamorphoses himself into a frog; and in the evening,when night is falling, in front of the bridges of Austerlitz and Jena,from the tops of coal wagons, and the washerwomen’s boats, he hurlshimself headlong into the Seine, and into all possible infractions ofthe laws of modesty and of the police.', 'Nevertheless the police keep aneye on him, and the result is a highly dramatic situation which oncegave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry; that cry which wascelebrated about 1830, is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin; itscans like a verse from Homer, with a notation as inexpressible as theeleusiac chant of the Panathenæa, and in it one encounters again theancient Evohe.', 'Here it is: “Ohé, Titi, ohééé!', 'Here comes the bobby,here comes the p’lice, pick up your duds and be off, through the sewerwith you!”Sometimes this gnat—that is what he calls himself—knows how to read;sometimes he knows how to write; he always knows how to daub.', 'He doesnot hesitate to acquire, by no one knows what mysterious mutualinstruction, all the talents which can be of use to the public; from1815 to 1830, he imitated the cry of the turkey; from 1830 to 1848, hescrawled pears on the walls.', 'One summer evening, when Louis Philippewas returning home on foot, he saw a little fellow, no higher than hisknee, perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal onone of the pillars of the gate of Neuilly; the King, with thatgood-nature which came to him from Henry IV., helped the gamin,finished the pear, and gave the child a louis, saying: “The pear is onthat also.', '\"19 The gamin loves uproar.', 'A certain state of violencepleases him.', 'He execrates “the curés.” One day, in the Rue del’Université, one of these scamps was putting his thumb to his nose atthe carriage gate of No.', '69.', '“Why are you doing that at the gate?” apasser-by asked.', 'The boy replied: “There is a curé there.” It wasthere, in fact, that the Papal Nuncio lived.Nevertheless, whatever may be the Voltairianism of the small gamin, ifthe occasion to become a chorister presents itself, it is quitepossible that he will accept, and in that case he serves the masscivilly.', 'There are two things to which he plays Tantalus, and which healways desires without ever attaining them: to overthrow thegovernment, and to get his trousers sewed up again.The gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of Paris,and can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances tomeet.', 'He can tell them off on the tips of his fingers.', 'He studies theirhabits, and he has special notes on each one of them.', 'He reads thesouls of the police like an open book.', 'He will tell you fluently andwithout flinching: “Such an one is a _traitor_; such another is very_malicious_; such another is _great_; such another is _ridiculous_.”(All these words: traitor, malicious, great, ridiculous, have aparticular meaning in his mouth.)', 'That one imagines that he owns thePont-Neuf, and he prevents _people_ from walking on the cornice outsidethe parapet; that other has a mania for pulling _person’s_ ears; etc.,etc.CHAPTER IX—THE OLD SOUL OF GAULThere was something of that boy in Poquelin, the son of thefish-market; Beaumarchais had something of it.', 'Gaminerie is a shade ofthe Gallic spirit.', 'Mingled with good sense, it sometimes adds force tothe latter, as alcohol does to wine.', 'Sometimes it is a defect.', 'Homerrepeats himself eternally, granted; one may say that Voltaire plays thegamin.', 'Camille Desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs.', 'Championnet,who treated miracles brutally, rose from the pavements of Paris; hehad, when a small lad, inundated the porticos of Saint-Jean deBeauvais, and of Saint-Étienne du Mont; he had addressed the shrine ofSainte-Geneviève familiarly to give orders to the phial of SaintJanuarius.The gamin of Paris is respectful, ironical, and insolent.', 'He hasvillainous teeth, because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers, andhandsome eyes because he has wit.', 'If Jehovah himself were present, hewould go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot.', 'He is strong onboxing.', 'All beliefs are possible to him.', 'He plays in the gutter, andstraightens himself up with a revolt; his effrontery persists even inthe presence of grape-shot; he was a scapegrace, he is a hero; like thelittle Theban, he shakes the skin from the lion; Barra the drummer-boywas a gamin of Paris; he Shouts: “Forward!” as the horse of Scripturesays “Vah!” and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to thegiant.This child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal.', 'Measure thatspread of wings which reaches from Molière to Barra.To sum up the whole, and in one word, the gamin is a being who amuseshimself, because he is unhappy.CHAPTER X—ECCE PARIS, ECCE HOMOTo sum it all up once more, the Paris gamin of to-day, like the_græculus_ of Rome in days gone by, is the infant populace with thewrinkle of the old world on his brow.The gamin is a grace to the nation, and at the same time a disease;

but he was merry becausehe was free.When these poor creatures grow to be men, the millstones of the socialorder meet them and crush them, but so long as they are children, theyescape because of their smallness.', 'The tiniest hole saves them.Nevertheless, abandoned as this child was, it sometimes happened, everytwo or three months, that he said, “Come, I’ll go and see mamma!” Thenhe quitted the boulevard, the Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin, descendedto the quays, crossed the bridges, reached the suburbs, arrived at theSalpêtrière, and came to a halt, where?', 'Precisely at that double number50-52 with which the reader is acquainted—at the Gorbeau hovel.At that epoch, the hovel 50-52 generally deserted and eternallydecorated with the placard: “Chambers to let,” chanced to be, a rarething, inhabited by numerous individuals who, however, as is always thecase in Paris, had no connection with each other.', 'All belonged to thatindigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of pettybourgeoisie in straitened circumstances, and which extends from miseryto misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beings inwhom all the material things of civilization end, the sewer-man whosweeps up the mud, and the rag-picker who collects scraps.The “principal lodger” of Jean Valjean’s day was dead and had beenreplaced by another exactly like her.', 'I know not what philosopher hassaid: “Old women are never lacking.”This new old woman was named Madame Bourgon, and had nothing remarkableabout her life except a dynasty of three paroquets, who had reigned insuccession over her soul.The most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family offour persons, consisting of father, mother, and two daughters, alreadywell grown, all four of whom were lodged in the same attic, one of thecells which we have already mentioned.At first sight, this family presented no very special feature exceptits extreme destitution; the father, when he hired the chamber, hadstated that his name was Jondrette.', 'Some time after his moving in,which had borne a singular resemblance to _the entrance of nothing atall_, to borrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant, thisJondrette had said to the woman, who, like her predecessor, was at thesame time portress and stair-sweeper: “Mother So-and-So, if any oneshould chance to come and inquire for a Pole or an Italian, or even aSpaniard, perchance, it is I.”This family was that of the merry barefoot boy.', 'He arrived there andfound distress, and, what is still sadder, no smile;

Gillenormand’s two daughters.', 'They had comeinto the world ten years apart.', 'In their youth they had borne verylittle resemblance to each other, either in character or countenance,and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible.', 'Theyoungest had a charming soul, which turned towards all that belongs tothe light, was occupied with flowers, with verses, with music, whichfluttered away into glorious space, enthusiastic, ethereal, and waswedded from her very youth, in ideal, to a vague and heroic figure.', 'Theelder had also her chimera; she espied in the azure some very wealthypurveyor, a contractor, a splendidly stupid husband, a million mademan, or even a prefect; the receptions of the Prefecture, an usher inthe antechamber with a chain on his neck, official balls, the haranguesof the town-hall, to be “Madame la Préfète,”—all this had created awhirlwind in her imagination.', 'Thus the two sisters strayed, each in herown dream, at the epoch when they were young girls.', 'Both had wings, theone like an angel, the other like a goose.No ambition is ever fully realized, here below at least.', 'No paradisebecomes terrestrial in our day.', 'The younger wedded the man of herdreams, but she died.', 'The elder did not marry at all.At the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which weare relating, she was an antique virtue, an incombustible prude, withone of the sharpest noses, and one of the most obtuse minds that it ispossible to see.', 'A characteristic detail; outside of her immediatefamily, no one had ever known her first name.', 'She was called_Mademoiselle Gillenormand, the elder_.In the matter of _cant_, Mademoiselle Gillenormand could have givenpoints to a miss.', 'Her modesty was carried to the other extreme ofblackness.', 'She cherished a frightful memory of her life; one day, a manhad beheld her garter.Age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty.', 'Her guimpe wasnever sufficiently opaque, and never ascended sufficiently high.', 'Shemultiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking.The peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels inproportion as the fortress is the less menaced.Nevertheless, let him who can explain these antique mysteries ofinnocence, she allowed an officer of the Lancers, her grand nephew,named Théodule, to embrace her without displeasure.In spite of this favored Lancer, the label: _Prude_, under which wehave classed her, suited her to absolute perfection.', 'MademoiselleGillenormand was a sort of twilight soul.', 'Prudery is a demi-virtue anda demi-vice.To prudery she added bigotry, a well-assorted lining.', 'She belonged tothe society of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain festivals,mumbled special orisons, revered “the holy blood,” venerated “thesacred heart,” remained for hours in contemplation before arococo-jesuit altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank andfile of the faithful, and there allowed her soul to soar among littleclouds of marble, and through great rays of gilded wood.She had a chapel friend, an ancient virgin like herself, namedMademoiselle Vaubois, who was a positive blockhead, and beside whomMademoiselle Gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle.', 'Beyondthe Agnus Dei and Ave Maria, Mademoiselle Vaubois had no knowledge ofanything except of the different ways of making preserves.', 'MademoiselleVaubois, perfect in her style, was the ermine of stupidity without asingle spot of intelligence.Let us say it plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather thanlost as she grew older.', 'This is the case with passive natures.', 'She hadnever been malicious, which is relative kindness; and then, years wearaway the angles, and the softening which comes with time had come toher.', 'She was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did notherself know the secret.', 'There breathed from her whole person thestupor of a life that was finished, and which had never had abeginning.She kept house for her father.', 'M. Gillenormand had his daughter nearhim, as we have seen that Monseigneur Bienvenu had his sister with him.These households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are notrare, and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning oneach other for support.There was also in this house, between this elderly spinster and thisold man, a child, a little boy, who was always trembling and mute inthe presence of M. Gillenormand.', 'M. Gillenormand never addressed thischild except in a severe voice, and sometimes, with uplifted cane:“Here, sir!', 'rascal, scoundrel, come here!—Answer me, you scamp!', 'Justlet me see you, you good-for-nothing!” etc., etc.', 'He idolized him.This was his grandson.', 'We shall meet with this child again later on.BOOK THIRD—THE GRANDFATHER AND THE GRANDSONCHAPTER I—AN ANCIENT SALONWhen M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequentedmany very good and very aristocratic salons.', 'Although a bourgeois, M.Gillenormand was received in society.', 'As he had a double measure ofwit, in the first place, that which was born with him, and secondly,that which was attributed to him, he was even sought out and made muchof.', 'He never went anywhere except on condition of being the chiefperson there.', 'There are people who will have influence at any price,and who will have other people busy themselves over them; when theycannot be oracles, they turn wags.', 'M. Gillenormand was not of thisnature; his domination in the Royalist salons which he frequented costhis self-respect nothing.', 'He was an oracle everywhere.', 'It had happenedto him to hold his own against M. de Bonald, and even against M.Bengy-Puy-Vallée.About 1817, he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house inhis own neighborhood, in the Rue Férou, with Madame la Baronne de T., aworthy and respectable person, whose husband had been Ambassador ofFrance to Berlin under Louis XVI.', 'Baron de T., who, during hislifetime, had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magneticvisions, had died bankrupt, during the emigration, leaving, as hisentire fortune, some very curious Memoirs about Mesmer and his tub, inten manuscript volumes, bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges.Madame de T. had not published the memoirs, out of pride, andmaintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knewhow.Madame de T. lived far from the Court; “a very mixed society,” as shesaid, in a noble isolation, proud and poor.', 'A few friends assembledtwice a week about her widowed hearth, and these constituted a purelyRoyalist salon.', 'They sipped tea there, and uttered groans or cries ofhorror at the century, the charter, the Bonapartists, the prostitutionof the blue ribbon, or the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII., according as thewind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs; and they spoke in low tones ofthe hopes which were presented by Monsieur, afterwards Charles X.The songs of the fishwomen, in which Napoleon was called _Nicolas_,were received there with transports of joy.', 'Duchesses, the mostdelicate and charming women in the world, went into ecstasies overcouplets like the following, addressed to “the federates”:—Refoncez dans vos culottesLe bout d’ chemis’ qui vous pend.Qu’on n’ dis’ pas qu’ les patriotesOnt arboré l’ drapeau blanc?20There they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible,with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous, withquatrains, with distiches even; thus, upon the Dessolles ministry, amoderate cabinet, of which MM.', 'Decazes and Deserre were members:—Pour raffermir le trône ébranlé sur sa base,Il faut changer de sol, et de serre et de case.21Or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers, “an abominably Jacobinchamber,” and from this list they combined alliances of names, in sucha manner as to form, for example, phrases like the following: _Damas.Sabran.', 'Gouvion-Saint-Cyr_.—All this was done merrily.', 'In that society,they parodied the Revolution.', 'They used I know not what desires to givepoint to the same wrath in inverse sense.', 'They sang their little _Çaira: _—Ah!', 'ça ira ça ira ça ira!Les Bonapartistes à la lanterne!Songs are like the guillotine; they chop away indifferently, to-daythis head, to-morrow that.', 'It is only a variation.In the Fualdès affair, which belongs to this epoch, 1816, they tookpart for Bastide and Jausion, because Fualdès was “a Buonapartist.”They designated the liberals as f_riends and brothers_; thisconstituted the most deadly insult.Like certain church towers, Madame de T.‘s salon had two cocks.', 'One ofthem was M. Gillenormand, the other was Comte de Lamothe-Valois, ofwhom it was whispered about, with a sort of respect: “Do you know?', 'Thatis the Lamothe of the affair of the necklace.” These singular amnestiesdo occur in parties.Let us add the following: in the bourgeoisie, honored situations decaythrough too easy relations; one must beware whom one admits; in thesame way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those whoare cold, there is a diminution of consideration in the approach ofdespised persons.', 'The ancient society of the upper classes heldthemselves above this law, as above every other.', 'Marigny, the brotherof the Pompadour, had his entry with M. le Prince de Soubise.', 'In spiteof?', 'No, because.', 'Du Barry, the god-father of the Vaubernier, was verywelcome at the house of M. le Maréchal de Richelieu.', 'This society isOlympus.', 'Mercury and the Prince de Guémenée are at home there.', 'A thiefis admitted there, provided he be a god.The Comte de Lamothe, who, in 1815, was an old man seventy-five yearsof age, had nothing remarkable about him except his silent andsententious air, his cold and angular face, his perfectly polishedmanners, his coat buttoned up to his cravat, and his long legs alwayscrossed in long, flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna.', 'His facewas the same color as his trousers.This M. de Lamothe was “held in consideration” in this salon on accountof his “celebrity” and, strange to say, though true, because of hisname of Valois.As for M. Gillenormand, his consideration was of absolutely first-ratequality.', 'He had, in spite of his levity, and without its interfering inany way with his dignity, a certain manner about him which wasimposing, dignified, honest, and lofty, in a bourgeois fashion; and hisgreat age added to it.', 'One is not a century with impunity.', 'The yearsfinally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment.In addition to this, he said things which had the genuine sparkle ofthe old rock.', 'Thus, when the King of Prussia, after having restoredLouis XVIII., came to pay the latter a visit under the name of theCount de Ruppin, he was received by the descendant of Louis XIV.somewhat as though he had been the Marquis de Brandebourg, and with themost delicate impertinence.', 'M. Gillenormand approved: “All kings whoare not the King of France,” said he, “are provincial kings.” One day,the following question was put and the following answer returned in hispresence: “To what was the editor of the _Courrier Français_condemned?” “To be suspended.” “_Sus_ is superfluous,” observed M.Gillenormand.22 Remarks of this nature found a situation.At the Te Deum on the anniversary of the return of the Bourbons, hesaid, on seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by: “There goes his Excellencythe Evil One.”M.', 'Gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter, that tallmademoiselle, who was over forty and looked fifty, and by a handsomelittle boy of seven years, white, rosy, fresh, with happy and trustingeyes, who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmuraround him: “How handsome he is!', 'What a pity!', 'Poor child!” This childwas the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago.', 'He was called “poorchild,” because he had for a father “a brigand of the Loire.”This brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand’s son-in-law, who hasalready been mentioned, and whom M. Gillenormand called “the disgraceof his family.”CHAPTER II—ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCHAny one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon atthis epoch, and who had happened to walk across that fine monumentalbridge, which will soon be succeeded, let us hope, by some hideous ironcable bridge, might have observed, had he dropped his eyes over theparapet, a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap, andtrousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth, to which somethingyellow which had been a red ribbon, was sewn, shod with wooden sabots,tanned by the sun, his face nearly black and his hair nearly white, alarge scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent,prematurely aged, who walked nearly every day, hoe and sickle in hand,in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on thebridge, and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces,charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were theymuch larger: “these are gardens,” and were they a little smaller:“these are bouquets.” All these enclosures abut upon the river at oneend, and on a house at the other.', 'The man in the waistcoat and thewooden shoes of whom we have just spoken, inhabited the smallest ofthese enclosures and the most humble of these houses about 1817.', 'Helived there alone and solitary, silently and poorly, with a woman whowas neither young nor old, neither homely nor pretty, neither a peasantnor a bourgeoise, who served him.', 'The plot of earth which he called hisgarden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers whichhe cultivated there.', 'These flowers were his occupation.By dint of labor, of perseverance, of attention, and of buckets ofwater, he had succeeded in creating after the Creator, and he hadinvented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have beenforgotten by nature.', 'He was ingenious; he had forestalled SoulangeBodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould, forthe cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from America and China.', 'Hewas in his alleys from the break of day, in summer, planting, cutting,hoeing, watering, walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness,sadness, and sweetness, sometimes standing motionless and thoughtfulfor hours, listening to the song of a bird in the trees, the babble ofa child in a house, or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tipof a spear of grass, of which the sun made a carbuncle.', 'His table wasvery plain, and he drank more milk than wine.', 'A child could make himgive way, and his servant scolded him.', 'He was so timid that he seemedshy, he rarely went out, and he saw no one but the poor people whotapped at his pane and his curé, the Abbé Mabeuf, a good old man.Nevertheless, if the inhabitants of the town, or strangers, or anychance comers, curious to see his tulips, rang at his little cottage,he opened his door with a smile.', 'He was the “brigand of the Loire.”Any one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, biographies,the _Moniteur_, and the bulletins of the grand army, would have beenstruck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency, the nameof Georges Pontmercy.', 'When very young, this Georges Pontmercy had beena soldier in Saintonge’s regiment.', 'The revolution broke out.Saintonge’s regiment formed a part of the army of the Rhine; for theold regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces evenafter the fall of the monarchy, and were only divided into brigades in1794.', 'Pontmercy fought at Spire, at Worms, at Neustadt, at Turkheim, atAlzey, at Mayence, where he was one of the two hundred who formedHouchard’s rearguard.', 'It was the twelfth to hold its ground against thecorps of the Prince of Hesse, behind the old rampart of Andernach, andonly rejoined the main body of the army when the enemy’s cannon hadopened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis.He was under Kléber at Marchiennes and at the battle of Mont-Palissel,where a ball from a biscaïen broke his arm.', 'Then he passed to thefrontier of Italy, and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defendedthe Col de Tende with Joubert.', 'Joubert was appointed itsadjutant-general, and Pontmercy sub-lieutenant.', 'Pontmercy was byBerthier’s side in the midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodiwhich caused Bonaparte to say: “Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier,and grenadier.” He beheld his old general, Joubert, fall at Novi, atthe moment when, with uplifted sabre, he was shouting: “Forward!”Having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of thecampaign, on board a pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa to someobscure port on the coast, he fell into a wasps’-nest of seven or eightEnglish vessels.', 'The Genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon intothe sea, to hide the soldiers between decks, and to slip along in thedark as a merchant vessel.', 'Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to thepeak, and sailed proudly past under the guns of the British frigates.Twenty leagues further on, his audacity having increased, he attackedwith his pinnace, and captured a large English transport which wascarrying troops to Sicily, and which was so loaded down with men andhorses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea.', 'In 1805 he wasin that Malher division which took Günzberg from the ArchdukeFerdinand.', 'At Weltingen he received into his arms, beneath a storm ofbullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at the head of the 9thDragoons.', 'He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that admirablemarch in echelons effected under the enemy’s fire.', 'When the cavalry ofthe Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the line,Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew theGuard.', 'The Emperor gave him the cross.', 'Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua,Mélas, and Alexandria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession.', 'Heformed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which Mortiercommanded, and which captured Hamburg.', 'Then he was transferred to the55th of the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders.', 'At Eylau hewas in the cemetery where, for the space of two hours, the heroicCaptain Louis Hugo, the uncle of the author of this book, sustainedalone with his company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostilearmy.', 'Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from thatcemetery.', 'He was at Friedland.', 'Then he saw Moscow.', 'Then La Bérésina,then Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, and the defiles ofGelenhausen;

Gillenormand tolerated; and the father answered themwith very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocketunread.CHAPTER III—REQUIESCANTMadame de T.‘s salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world.It was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life.This opening was sombre, and more cold than warmth, more night thanday, came to him through this skylight.', 'This child, who had been alljoy and light on entering this strange world, soon became melancholy,and, what is still more contrary to his age, grave.', 'Surrounded by allthose singular and imposing personages, he gazed about him with seriousamazement.', 'Everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him.There were in Madame de T.‘s salon some very noble ladies named Mathan,Noé, Lévis,—which was pronounced Lévi,—Cambis, pronounced Cambyse.These antique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child’smind with the Old Testament which he was learning by heart, and whenthey were all there, seated in a circle around a dying fire, sparelylighted by a lamp shaded with green, with their severe profiles, theirgray or white hair, their long gowns of another age, whose lugubriouscolors could not be distinguished, dropping, at rare intervals, wordswhich were both majestic and severe, little Marius stared at them withfrightened eyes, in the conviction that he beheld not women, butpatriarchs and magi, not real beings, but phantoms.With these phantoms, priests were sometimes mingled, frequenters ofthis ancient salon, and some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****,private secretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, whopublished, under the pseudonym of _Charles-Antoine_, monorhymed odes,the Prince de Beauff*******, who, though very young, had a gray headand a pretty and witty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarletvelvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C*****d’E******, the man in all France who best understood “proportionedpoliteness,” the Comte d’Am*****, the kindly man with the amiable chin,and the Chévalier de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of theLouvre, called the King’s cabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and ratheraged than old, was wont to relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen,he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with anoctogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix, also refractory, but as a priest,while he was so in the capacity of a soldier.', 'This was at Toulon.', 'Theirbusiness was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads andbodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day; theybore away on their backs these dripping corpses, and their redgalley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck, whichwas dry in the morning and wet at night.', 'These tragic tales abounded inMadame de T.‘s salon, and by dint of cursing Marat, they applaudedTrestaillon.', 'Some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played theirwhist there; M. Thibord du Chalard, M. Lemarchant de Gomicourt, and thecelebrated scoffer of the right, M.

dignified to harshness, pure to shyness.CHAPTER IV—END OF THE BRIGANDThe conclusion of Marius’ classical studies coincided with M.Gillenormand’s departure from society.', 'The old man bade farewell to theFaubourg Saint-Germain and to Madame de T.‘s salon, and establishedhimself in the Marais, in his house of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.There he had for servants, in addition to the porter, that chambermaid,Nicolette, who had succeeded to Magnon, and that short-breathed andpursy Basque, who have been mentioned above.In 1827, Marius had just attained his seventeenth year.', 'One evening, onhis return home, he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand.“Marius,” said M. Gillenormand, “you will set out for Vernonto-morrow.”“Why?” said Marius.“To see your father.”Marius was seized with a trembling fit.', 'He had thought of everythingexcept this—that he should one day be called upon to see his father.Nothing could be more unexpected, more surprising, and, let us admitit, more disagreeable to him.', 'It was forcing estrangement intoreconciliation.', 'It was not an affliction, but it was an unpleasantduty.Marius, in addition to his motives of political antipathy, wasconvinced that his father, _the slasher_, as M. Gillenormand called himon his amiable days, did not love him; this was evident, since he hadabandoned him to others.', 'Feeling that he was not beloved, he did notlove.', '“Nothing is more simple,” he said to himself.He was so astounded that he did not question M. Gillenormand.', 'Thegrandfather resumed:—“It appears that he is ill.', 'He demands your presence.”And after a pause, he added:—“Set out to-morrow morning.', 'I think there is a coach which leaves theCour des Fontaines at six o’clock, and which arrives in the evening.Take it.', 'He says that here is haste.”Then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket.Marius might have set out that very evening and have been with hisfather on the following morning.', 'A diligence from the Rue du Bouloitook the trip to Rouen by night at that date, and passed throughVernon.', 'Neither Marius nor M. Gillenormand thought of making inquiriesabout it.The next day, at twilight, Marius reached Vernon.', 'People were justbeginning to light their candles.', 'He asked the first person whom he metfor “M.', 'Pontmercy’s house.” For in his own mind, he agreed with theRestoration, and like it, did not recognize his father’s claim to thetitle of either colonel or baron.The house was pointed out to him.', 'He rang; a woman with a little lampin her hand opened the door.“M.', 'Pontmercy?” said Marius.The woman remained motionless.“Is this his house?” demanded Marius.The woman nodded affirmatively.“Can I speak with him?”The woman shook her head.“But I am his son!” persisted Marius.', '“He is expecting me.”“He no longer expects you,” said the woman.Then he perceived that she was weeping.She pointed to the door of a room on the ground floor; he entered.In that room, which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on thechimney-piece, there were three men, one standing erect, anotherkneeling, and one lying at full length, on the floor in his shirt.', 'Theone on the floor was the colonel.The other two were the doctor, and the priest, who was engaged inprayer.The colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously.', 'Ashe had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness, hehad written to M. Gillenormand to demand his son.', 'The malady had grownworse.', 'On the very evening of Marius’ arrival at Vernon, the colonelhad had an attack of delirium; he had risen from his bed, in spite ofthe servant’s efforts to prevent him, crying: “My son is not coming!', 'Ishall go to meet him!” Then he ran out of his room and fell prostrateon the floor of the antechamber.', 'He had just expired.The doctor had been summoned, and the curé.', 'The doctor had arrived toolate.', 'The son had also arrived too late.By the dim light of the candle, a large tear could be distinguished onthe pale and prostrate colonel’s cheek, where it had trickled from hisdead eye.', 'The eye was extinguished, but the tear was not yet dry.', 'Thattear was his son’s delay.Marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time, on thatvenerable and manly face, on those open eyes which saw not, on thosewhite locks, those robust limbs, on which, here and there, brown lines,marking sword-thrusts, and a sort of red stars, which indicatedbullet-holes, were visible.', 'He contemplated that gigantic sear whichstamped heroism on that countenance upon which God had imprintedgoodness.', 'He reflected that this man was his father, and that this manwas dead, and a chill ran over him.The sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in thepresence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched outin death.Anguish, poignant anguish, was in that chamber.', 'The servant-woman waslamenting in a corner, the curé was praying, and his sobs were audible,the doctor was wiping his eyes; the corpse itself was weeping.The doctor, the priest, and the woman gazed at Marius in the midst oftheir affliction without uttering a word; he was the stranger there.Marius, who was far too little affected, felt ashamed and embarrassedat his own attitude; he held his hat in his hand; and he dropped it onthe floor, in order to produce the impression that grief had deprivedhim of the strength to hold it.At the same time, he experienced remorse, and he despised himself forbehaving in this manner.', 'But was it his fault?', 'He did not love hisfather?', 'Why should he!The colonel had left nothing.', 'The sale of big furniture barely paid theexpenses of his burial.The servant found a scrap of paper, which she handed to Marius.', 'Itcontained the following, in the colonel’s handwriting:—“_For my son_.—The Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-field ofWaterloo.', 'Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which Ipurchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it.', 'That he willbe worthy of it is a matter of course.” Below, the colonel had added:“At that same battle of Waterloo, a sergeant saved my life.', 'The man’sname was Thénardier.', 'I think that he has recently been keeping a littleinn, in a village in the neighborhood of Paris, at Chelles orMontfermeil.', 'If my son meets him, he will do all the good he can toThénardier.”Marius took this paper and preserved it, not out of duty to his father,but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperiousin the heart of man.Nothing remained of the colonel.', 'M. Gillenormand had his sword anduniform sold to an old-clothes dealer.', 'The neighbors devastated thegarden and pillaged the rare flowers.', 'The other plants turned tonettles and weeds, and died.Marius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon.', 'After the intermenthe returned to Paris, and applied himself again to his law studies,with no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived.In two days the colonel was buried, and in three forgotten.Marius wore crape on his hat.', 'That was all.CHAPTER V—THE UTILITY OF GOING TO MASS, IN ORDER TO BECOME AREVOLUTIONISTMarius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood.', 'One Sunday,when he went to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at that same chapel of theVirgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad, he placed himselfbehind a pillar, being more absent-minded and thoughtful than usual onthat occasion, and knelt down, without paying any special heed, upon achair of Utrecht velvet, on the back of which was inscribed this name:_Monsieur Mabeuf, warden_.', 'Mass had hardly begun when an old manpresented himself and said to Marius:—“This is my place, sir.”Marius stepped aside promptly, and the old man took possession of hischair.The mass concluded, Marius still stood thoughtfully a few pacesdistant; the old man approached him again and said:—“I beg your pardon, sir, for having disturbed you a while ago, and foragain disturbing you at this moment; you must have thought meintrusive, and I will explain myself.”“There is no need of that, Sir,” said Marius.“Yes!” went on the old man, “I do not wish you to have a bad opinion ofme.', 'You see, I am attached to this place.', 'It seems to me that the massis better from here.', 'Why?', 'I will tell you.', 'It is from this place, thatI have watched a poor, brave father come regularly, every two or threemonths, for the last ten years, since he had no other opportunity andno other way of seeing his child, because he was prevented by familyarrangements.', 'He came at the hour when he knew that his son would bebrought to mass.', 'The little one never suspected that his father wasthere.', 'Perhaps he did not even know that he had a father, poorinnocent!', 'The father kept behind a pillar, so that he might not beseen.', 'He gazed at his child and he wept.', 'He adored that little fellow,poor man!', 'I could see that.', 'This spot has become sanctified in mysight, and I have contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to themass.', 'I prefer it to the stall to which I have a right, in my capacityof warden.', 'I knew that unhappy gentleman a little, too.', 'He had afather-in-law, a wealthy aunt, relatives, I don’t know exactly whatall, who threatened to disinherit the child if he, the father, saw him.He sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happysome day.', 'He was separated from him because of political opinions.Certainly, I approve of political opinions, but there are people who donot know where to stop.', 'Mon Dieu!', 'a man is not a monster because he wasat Waterloo; a father is not separated from his child for such a reasonas that.', 'He was one of Bonaparte’s colonels.', 'He is dead, I believe.', 'Helived at Vernon, where I have a brother who is a curé, and his name wassomething like Pontmarie or Montpercy.', 'He had a fine sword-cut, on myhonor.”“Pontmercy,” suggested Marius, turning pale.“Precisely, Pontmercy.', 'Did you know him?”“Sir,” said Marius, “he was my father.”The old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed:—“Ah!', 'you are the child!', 'Yes, that’s true, he must be a man by thistime.', 'Well!', 'poor child, you may say that you had a father who loved youdearly!”Marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to hislodgings.On the following day, he said to M. Gillenormand:—“I have arranged a hunting-party with some friends.', 'Will you permit meto be absent for three days?”“Four!” replied his grandfather.', '“Go and amuse yourself.”And he said to his daughter in a low tone, and with a wink, “Some loveaffair!”CHAPTER VI—THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING MET A WARDENWhere it was that Marius went will be disclosed a little further on.Marius was absent for three days, then he returned to Paris, wentstraight to the library of the law-school and asked for the files ofthe _Moniteur_.He read the _Moniteur_, he read all the histories of the Republic andthe Empire, the _Memorial de Sainte-Hélène_, all the memoirs, all thenewspapers, the bulletins, the proclamations; he devoured everything.The first time that he came across his father’s name in the bulletinsof the grand army, he had a fever for a week.', 'He went to see thegenerals under whom Georges Pontmercy had served, among others, ComteH.', 'Church-warden Mabeuf, whom he went to see again, told him about thelife at Vernon, the colonel’s retreat, his flowers, his solitude.Marius came to a full knowledge of that rare, sweet, and sublime man,that species of lion-lamb who had been his father.In the meanwhile, occupied as he was with this study which absorbed allhis moments as well as his thoughts, he hardly saw the Gillenormands atall.', 'He made his appearance at meals; then they searched for him, andhe was not to be found.', 'Father Gillenormand smiled.', '“Bah!', 'bah!', 'He isjust of the age for the girls!” Sometimes the old man added: “Thedeuce!', 'I thought it was only an affair of gallantry.', 'It seems that itis an affair of passion!”It was a passion, in fact.', 'Marius was on the high road to adoring hisfather.At the same time, his ideas underwent an extraordinary change.', 'Thephases of this change were numerous and successive.', 'As this is thehistory of many minds of our day, we think it will prove useful tofollow these phases step by step and to indicate them all.That history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him.The first effect was to dazzle him.Up to that time, the Republic, the Empire, had been to him onlymonstrous words.', 'The Republic, a guillotine in the twilight; theEmpire, a sword in the night.', 'He had just taken a look at it, and wherehe had expected to find only a chaos of shadows, he had beheld, with asort of unprecedented surprise, mingled with fear and joy, starssparkling, Mirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, Robespierre, Camille,Desmoulins, Danton, and a sun arise, Napoleon.', 'He did not know where hestood.', 'He recoiled, blinded by the brilliant lights.', 'Little by little,when his astonishment had passed off, he grew accustomed to thisradiance, he contemplated these deeds without dizziness, he examinedthese personages without terror; the Revolution and the Empirepresented themselves luminously, in perspective, before his mind’s eye;he beheld each of these groups of events and of men summed up in twotremendous facts: the Republic in the sovereignty of civil rightrestored to the masses, the Empire in the sovereignty of the Frenchidea imposed on Europe; he beheld the grand figure of the people emergefrom the Revolution, and the grand figure of France spring forth fromthe Empire.', 'He asserted in his conscience, that all this had been good.What his dazzled state neglected in this, his first far too syntheticestimation, we do not think it necessary to point out here.', 'It is thestate of a mind on the march that we are recording.', 'Progress is notaccomplished in one stage.', 'That stated, once for all, in connectionwith what precedes as well as with what is to follow, we continue.He then perceived that, up to that moment, he had comprehended hiscountry no more than he had comprehended his father.', 'He had not knowneither the one or the other, and a sort of voluntary night had obscuredhis eyes.', 'Now he saw, and on the one hand he admired, while on theother he adored.He was filled with regret and remorse, and he reflected in despair thatall he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb.', 'Oh!', 'if hisfather had still been in existence, if he had still had him, if God, inhis compassion and his goodness, had permitted his father to be stillamong the living, how he would have run, how he would have precipitatedhimself, how he would have cried to his father: “Father!', 'Here I am!', 'Itis I!', 'I have the same heart as thou!', 'I am thy son!” How he would haveembraced that white head, bathed his hair in tears, gazed upon hisscar, pressed his hands, adored his garment, kissed his feet!', 'Oh!', 'Whyhad his father died so early, before his time, before the justice, thelove of his son had come to him?', 'Marius had a continual sob in hisheart, which said to him every moment: “Alas!” At the same time, hebecame more truly serious, more truly grave, more sure of his thoughtand his faith.', 'At each instant, gleams of the true came to complete hisreason.', 'An inward growth seemed to be in progress within him.', 'He wasconscious of a sort of natural enlargement, which gave him two thingsthat were new to him—his father and his country.As everything opens when one has a key, so he explained to himself thatwhich he had hated, he penetrated that which he had abhorred;henceforth he plainly perceived the providential, divine and humansense of the great things which he had been taught to detest, and ofthe great men whom he had been instructed to curse.', 'When he reflectedon his former opinions, which were but those of yesterday, and which,nevertheless, seemed to him already so very ancient, he grew indignant,yet he smiled.From the rehabilitation of his father, he naturally passed to therehabilitation of Napoleon.But the latter, we will confess, was not effected without labor.From his infancy, he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of1814, on Bonaparte.', 'Now, all the prejudices of the Restoration, all itsinterests, all its instincts tended to disfigure Napoleon.', 'It execratedhim even more than it did Robespierre.', 'It had very cleverly turned tosufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation, and the hatred ofmothers.', 'Bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster, and in orderto paint him to the imagination of the people, which, as we latelypointed out, resembles the imagination of children, the party of 1814made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession, fromthat which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which isterrible and becomes grotesque, from Tiberius to the bugaboo.', 'Thus, inspeaking of Bonaparte, one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter,provided that hatred lay at the bottom.', 'Marius had neverentertained—about _that man_, as he was called—any other ideas in hismind.', 'They had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature.There was in him a headstrong little man who hated Napoleon.On reading history, on studying him, especially in the documents andmaterials for history, the veil which concealed Napoleon from the eyesof Marius was gradually rent.', 'He caught a glimpse of something immense,and he suspected that he had been deceived up to that moment, on thescore of Bonaparte as about all the rest; each day he saw moredistinctly; and he set about mounting, slowly, step by step, almostregretfully in the beginning, then with intoxication and as thoughattracted by an irresistible fascination, first the sombre steps, thenthe vaguely illuminated steps, at last the luminous and splendid stepsof enthusiasm.One night, he was alone in his little chamber near the roof.', 'His candlewas burning; he was reading, with his elbows resting on his table closeto the open window.', 'All sorts of reveries reached him from space, andmingled with his thoughts.', 'What a spectacle is the night!', 'One hearsdull sounds, without knowing whence they proceed; one beholds Jupiter,which is twelve hundred times larger than the earth, glowing like afirebrand, the azure is black, the stars shine; it is formidable.He was perusing the bulletins of the grand army, those heroic strophespenned on the field of battle; there, at intervals, he beheld hisfather’s name, always the name of the Emperor; the whole of that greatEmpire presented itself to him; he felt a flood swelling and risingwithin him; it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close tohim like a breath, and whispered in his ear; he gradually got into asingular state; he thought that he heard drums, cannon, trumpets, themeasured tread of battalions, the dull and distant gallop of thecavalry; from time to time, his eyes were raised heavenward, and gazedupon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measurelessdepths of space, then they fell upon his book once more, and there theybeheld other colossal things moving confusedly.', 'His heart contractedwithin him.', 'He was in a transport, trembling, panting.', 'All at once,without himself knowing what was in him, and what impulse he wasobeying, he sprang to his feet, stretched both arms out of the window,gazed intently into the gloom, the silence, the infinite darkness, theeternal immensity, and exclaimed: “Long live the Emperor!”From that moment forth, all was over;

I am travelling by diligence.', 'And, by the way, Iwant to ask you something.”“What is it?”“Is my cousin Marius Pontmercy travelling so, too?”“How do you know that?” said his aunt, suddenly pricked to the quickwith a lively curiosity.“On my arrival, I went to the diligence to engage my seat in thecoupé.”“Well?”“A traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial.', 'I sawhis name on the card.”“What name?”“Marius Pontmercy.”“The wicked fellow!” exclaimed his aunt.', '“Ah!', 'your cousin is not asteady lad like yourself.', 'To think that he is to pass the night in adiligence!”“Just as I am going to do.”“But you—it is your duty;

but he wasmuch touched by the ten louis, and he thought he saw a chance for apossible sequel.', 'He accepted the commission and said: “As you please,aunt.”And he added in an aside, to himself: “Here I am a duenna.”Mademoiselle Gillenormand embraced him.“You are not the man to play such pranks, Théodule.', 'You obeydiscipline, you are the slave of orders, you are a man of scruples andduty, and you would not quit your family to go and see a creature.”The lancer made the pleased grimace of Cartouche when praised for hisprobity.Marius, on the evening following this dialogue, mounted the diligencewithout suspecting that he was watched.', 'As for the watcher, the firstthing he did was to fall asleep.', 'His slumber was complete andconscientious.', 'Argus snored all night long.At daybreak, the conductor of the diligence shouted: “Vernon!', 'relay ofVernon!', 'Travellers for Vernon!” And Lieutenant Théodule woke.“Good,” he growled, still half asleep, “this is where I get out.”Then, as his memory cleared by degrees, the effect of waking, herecalled his aunt, the ten louis, and the account which he hadundertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of Marius.', 'This sethim to laughing.“Perhaps he is no longer in the coach,” he thought, as he rebuttonedthe waistcoat of his undress uniform.', '“He may have stopped at Poissy;he may have stopped at Triel;

he did not glance at them.', 'He seemed to see nothing aroundhim.“He is pretty deeply in love!” thought Théodule.Marius directed his steps towards the church.“Capital,” said Théodule to himself.', '“Rendezvous seasoned with a bit ofmass are the best sort.', 'Nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passesover the good God’s head.”On arriving at the church, Marius did not enter it, but skirted theapse.', 'He disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse.“The rendezvous is appointed outside,” said Théodule.', '“Let’s have alook at the lass.”And he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner whichMarius had turned.On arriving there, he halted in amazement.Marius, with his forehead clasped in his hands, was kneeling upon thegrass on a grave.', 'He had strewn his bouquet there.', 'At the extremity ofthe grave, on a little swelling which marked the head, there stood across of black wood with this name in white letters: COLONEL BARONPONTMERCY.', 'Marius’ sobs were audible.The “lass” was a grave.CHAPTER VIII—MARBLE AGAINST GRANITEIt was hither that Marius had come on the first occasion of hisabsenting himself from Paris.', 'It was hither that he had come every timethat M. Gillenormand had said: “He is sleeping out.”Lieutenant Théodule was absolutely put out of countenance by thisunexpected encounter with a sepulchre; he experienced a singular anddisagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing, and whichwas composed of respect for the tomb, mingled with respect for thecolonel.', 'He retreated, leaving Marius alone in the cemetery, and therewas discipline in this retreat.', 'Death appeared to him with largeepaulets, and he almost made the military salute to him.', 'Not knowingwhat to write to his aunt, he decided not to write at all; and it isprobable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made byThéodule as to the love affairs of Marius, if, by one of thosemysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance, the scene atVernon had not had an almost immediate counter-shock at Paris.Marius returned from Vernon on the third day, in the middle of themorning, descended at his grandfather’s door, and, wearied by the twonights spent in the diligence, and feeling the need of repairing hisloss of sleep by an hour at the swimming-school, he mounted rapidly tohis chamber, took merely time enough to throw off his travelling-coat,and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck, and went off to thebath.M.', 'Gillenormand, who had risen betimes like all old men in good health,had heard his entrance, and had made haste to climb, as quickly as hisold legs permitted, the stairs to the upper story where Marius lived,in order to embrace him, and to question him while so doing, and tofind out where he had been.But the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had toascend, and when Father Gillenormand entered the attic, Marius was nolonger there.The bed had not been disturbed, and on the bed lay, outspread, but notdefiantly the great-coat and the black ribbon.“I like this better,” said M. Gillenormand.And a moment later, he made his entrance into the salon, whereMademoiselle Gillenormand was already seated, busily embroidering hercart-wheels.The entrance was a triumphant one.M.', 'Gillenormand held in one hand the great-coat, and in the other theneck-ribbon, and exclaimed:—“Victory!', 'We are about to penetrate the mystery!', 'We are going to learnthe most minute details; we are going to lay our finger on thedebaucheries of our sly friend!', 'Here we have the romance itself.', 'I havethe portrait!”In fact, a case of black shagreen, resembling a medallion portrait, wassuspended from the ribbon.The old man took this case and gazed at it for some time withoutopening it, with that air of enjoyment, rapture, and wrath, with whicha poor hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him,pass under his very nose.“For this evidently is a portrait.', 'I know all about such things.', 'Thatis worn tenderly on the heart.', 'How stupid they are!', 'Some abominablefright that will make us shudder, probably!', 'Young men have such badtaste nowadays!”“Let us see, father,” said the old spinster.The case opened by the pressure of a spring.', 'They found in it nothingbut a carefully folded paper._“From the same to the same,”_ said M. Gillenormand, bursting withlaughter.', '“I know what it is.', 'A billet-doux.”“Ah!', 'let us read it!” said the aunt.And she put on her spectacles.', 'They unfolded the paper and read asfollows:—“_For my son_.—The Emperor made me a Baron on the battlefield ofWaterloo.', 'Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which Ipurchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it.', 'That he willbe worthy of it is a matter of course.”The feelings of father and daughter cannot be described.', 'They feltchilled as by the breath of a death’s-head.', 'They did not exchange aword.Only, M. Gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking tohimself:—“It is the slasher’s handwriting.”The aunt examined the paper, turned it about in all directions, thenput it back in its case.At the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper,fell from one of the pockets of the great-coat.', 'MademoiselleGillenormand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper.It contained Marius’ hundred cards.', 'She handed one of them to M.Gillenormand, who read: _Le Baron Marius Pontmercy_.The old man rang the bell.', 'Nicolette came.', 'M. Gillenormand took theribbon, the case, and the coat, flung them all on the floor in themiddle of the room, and said:—“Carry those duds away.”A full hour passed in the most profound silence.', 'The old man and theold spinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other, andwere thinking, each on his own account, the same things, in allprobability.At the expiration of this hour, Aunt Gillenormand said:—“A pretty stateof things!”A few moments later, Marius made his appearance.', 'He entered.', 'Evenbefore he had crossed the threshold, he saw his grandfather holding oneof his own cards in his hand, and on catching sight of him, the latterexclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which wassomething crushing:—“Well!', 'well!', 'well!', 'well!', 'well!', 'so you are a baron now.', 'I present you mycompliments.', 'What is the meaning of this?”Marius reddened slightly and replied:—“It means that I am the son of my father.”M.', 'Gillenormand ceased to laugh, and said harshly:—“I am your father.”“My father,” retorted Marius, with downcast eyes and a severe air, “wasa humble and heroic man, who served the Republic and France gloriously,who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made, wholived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century, beneath grape-shot andbullets, in snow and mud by day, beneath rain at night, who capturedtwo flags, who received twenty wounds, who died forgotten andabandoned, and who never committed but one mistake, which was to lovetoo fondly two ingrates, his country and myself.”This was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear.', 'At the word_republic_, he rose, or, to speak more correctly, he sprang to hisfeet.', 'Every word that Marius had just uttered produced on the visage ofthe old Royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon ablazing brand.', 'From a dull hue he had turned red, from red, purple, andfrom purple, flame-colored.“Marius!” he cried.', '“Abominable child!', 'I do not know what your fatherwas!', 'I do not wish to know!', 'I know nothing about that, and I do notknow him!', 'But what I do know is, that there never was anything butscoundrels among those men!', 'They were all rascals, assassins, red-caps,thieves!', 'I say all!', 'I say all!', 'I know not one!', 'I say all!', 'Do you hearme, Marius!', 'See here, you are no more a baron than my slipper is!', 'Theywere all bandits in the service of Robespierre!', 'All who servedB-u-o-naparté were brigands!', 'They were all traitors who betrayed,betrayed, betrayed their legitimate king!', 'All cowards who fled beforethe Prussians and the English at Waterloo!', 'That is what I do know!Whether Monsieur your father comes in that category, I do not know!', 'Iam sorry for it, so much the worse, your humble servant!”In his turn, it was Marius who was the firebrand and M.

Gillenormand said to his daughter:“You will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood-drinker,and you will never mention his name to me.”Having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of, and not knowingwhat to do with it, he continued to address his daughter as _you_instead of _thou_ for the next three months.Marius, on his side, had gone forth in indignation.', 'There was onecircumstance which, it must be admitted, aggravated his exasperation.There are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domesticdramas.', 'They augment the grievances in such cases, although, inreality, the wrongs are not increased by them.', 'While carrying Marius’“duds” precipitately to his chamber, at his grandfather’s command,Nicolette had, inadvertently, let fall, probably, on the atticstaircase, which was dark, that medallion of black shagreen whichcontained the paper penned by the colonel.', 'Neither paper nor case couldafterwards be found.', 'Marius was convinced that “MonsieurGillenormand”—from that day forth he never alluded to him otherwise—hadflung “his father’s testament” in the fire.', 'He knew by heart the fewlines which the colonel had written, and, consequently, nothing waslost.', 'But the paper, the writing, that sacred relic,—all that was hisvery heart.', 'What had been done with it?Marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going, andwithout knowing where, with thirty francs, his watch, and a few clothesin a hand-bag.', 'He had entered a hackney-coach, had engaged it by thehour, and had directed his course at hap-hazard towards the Latinquarter.What was to become of Marius?BOOK FOURTH—THE FRIENDS OF THE A B CCHAPTER I—A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORICAt that epoch, which was, to all appearances indifferent, a certainrevolutionary quiver was vaguely current.', 'Breaths which had startedforth from the depths of ’89 and ’93 were in the air.', 'Youth was on thepoint, may the reader pardon us the word, of moulting.', 'People wereundergoing a transformation, almost without being conscious of it,through the movement of the age.', 'The needle which moves round thecompass also moves in souls.', 'Each person was taking that step inadvance which he was bound to take.', 'The Royalists were becomingliberals, liberals were turning democrats.', 'It was a flood tidecomplicated with a thousand ebb movements;

that is to say, he endured great hardships andprivations.', 'A terrible thing it is, containing days without bread,nights without sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without afire, weeks without work, a future without hope, a coat out at theelbows, an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls, a doorwhich one finds locked on one at night because one’s rent is not paid,the insolence of the porter and the cook-shop man, the sneers ofneighbors, humiliations, dignity trampled on, work of whatever natureaccepted, disgusts, bitterness, despondency.', 'Marius learned how allthis is eaten, and how such are often the only things which one has todevour.', 'At that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride,because he needs love, he felt that he was jeered at because he wasbadly dressed, and ridiculous because he was poor.', 'At the age whenyouth swells the heart with imperial pride, he dropped his eyes morethan once on his dilapidated boots, and he knew the unjust shame andthe poignant blushes of wretchedness.', 'Admirable and terrible trial fromwhich the feeble emerge base, from which the strong emerge sublime.', 'Acrucible into which destiny casts a man, whenever it desires ascoundrel or a demi-god.For many great deeds are performed in petty combats.', 'There areinstances of bravery ignored and obstinate, which defend themselvesstep by step in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes.Noble and mysterious triumphs which no eye beholds, which are requitedwith no renown, which are saluted with no trumpet blast.', 'Life,misfortune, isolation, abandonment, poverty, are the fields of battlewhich have their heroes; obscure heroes, who are, sometimes, granderthan the heroes who win renown.Firm and rare natures are thus created; misery, almost always astep-mother, is sometimes a mother; destitution gives birth to might ofsoul and spirit; distress is the nurse of pride; unhappiness is a goodmilk for the magnanimous.There came a moment in Marius’ life, when he swept his own landing,when he bought his sou’s worth of Brie cheese at the fruiterer’s, whenhe waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker’s andpurchase a loaf, which he carried off furtively to his attic as thoughhe had stolen it.', 'Sometimes there could be seen gliding into thebutcher’s shop on the corner, in the midst of the bantering cooks whoelbowed him, an awkward young man, carrying big books under his arm,who had a timid yet angry air, who, on entering, removed his hat from abrow whereon stood drops of perspiration, made a profound bow to thebutcher’s astonished wife, asked for a mutton cutlet, paid six or sevensous for it, wrapped it up in a paper, put it under his arm, betweentwo books, and went away.', 'It was Marius.', 'On this cutlet, which hecooked for himself, he lived for three days.On the first day he ate the meat, on the second he ate the fat, on thethird he gnawed the bone.', 'Aunt Gillenormand made repeated attempts, andsent him the sixty pistoles several times.', 'Marius returned them onevery occasion, saying that he needed nothing.He was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which wehave just described was effected within him.', 'From that time forth, hehad not put off his black garments.', 'But his garments were quitting him.The day came when he had no longer a coat.', 'The trousers would go next.What was to be done?', 'Courfeyrac, to whom he had, on his side, done somegood turns, gave him an old coat.', 'For thirty sous, Marius got it turnedby some porter or other, and it was a new coat.', 'But this coat wasgreen.', 'Then Marius ceased to go out until after nightfall.', 'This madehis coat black.', 'As he wished always to appear in mourning, he clothedhimself with the night.In spite of all this, he got admitted to practice as a lawyer.', 'He wassupposed to live in Courfeyrac’s room, which was decent, and where acertain number of law-books backed up and completed by severaldilapidated volumes of romance, passed as the library required by theregulations.', 'He had his letters addressed to Courfeyrac’s quarters.When Marius became a lawyer, he informed his grandfather of the fact ina letter which was cold but full of submission and respect.', 'M.Gillenormand trembled as he took the letter, read it, tore it in fourpieces, and threw it into the waste-basket.', 'Two or three days later,Mademoiselle Gillenormand heard her father, who was alone in his room,talking aloud to himself.', 'He always did this whenever he was greatlyagitated.', 'She listened, and the old man was saying: “If you were not afool, you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at thesame time.”CHAPTER II—MARIUS POORIt is the same with wretchedness as with everything else.', 'It ends bybecoming bearable.', 'It finally assumes a form, and adjusts itself.', 'Onevegetates, that is to say, one develops in a certain meagre fashion,which is, however, sufficient for life.', 'This is the mode in which theexistence of Marius Pontmercy was arranged:He had passed the worst straits; the narrow pass was opening out alittle in front of him.', 'By dint of toil, perseverance, courage, andwill, he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs ayear.', 'He had learned German and English; thanks to Courfeyrac, who hadput him in communication with his friend the publisher, Marius filledthe modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishinghouse.', 'He drew up prospectuses, translated newspapers, annotatededitions, compiled biographies, etc.', '; net product, year in and yearout, seven hundred francs.', 'He lived on it.', 'How?', 'Not so badly.', 'We willexplain.Marius occupied in the Gorbeau house, for an annual sum of thirtyfrancs, a den minus a fireplace, called a cabinet, which contained onlythe most indispensable articles of furniture.', 'This furniture belongedto him.']\n"
